I’m excited to share my (record) fourth collaboration with the great

Noam Segal

, AI Insights Manager at Figma and former UXR leader at Zapier, Airbnb, Meta, Twitter, Intercom, and Wealthfront. Let’s get to it.

Author’s note:

Names have been changed to preserve participant anonymity.

There’s no shortage of debate about AI’s impact on work. Is it delivering real productivity gains? Where’s the ROI? Hot takes abound, but data have been scarce.

We took it upon ourselves to find out what’s actually happening on the ground by running one of the largest independent, in-depth surveys on how AI is affecting productivity for tech workers (1,750 respondents). We surveyed product managers, engineers, designers, founders, and others about how they’re using AI at work.

tl;dr: AI is

overdelivering

.

55% of respondents say AI has

exceeded

their expectations, and almost 70% say it’s improved the

quality

of their work.

More than half of respondents said AI is saving them at least half a day per week

on their most important tasks. We’ve never seen a tool deliver a productivity boost like this before.

Founders are getting the most out of AI.

Half (49%) report that AI saves them

over

6 hours per week

, dramatically higher than for any other role. Close to half (45%) also feel that the quality of their work is “much better” thanks to AI.

Designers are seeing the fewest benefits.

Only 45% report a positive ROI (compared with 78% of founders), and 31% report that AI has fallen below expectations, triple the rate among founders.

Engineers have accepted AI as a coding partner and now want it to handle the more boring (but necessary) work of building products:

documentation, code review, and writing tests

.

n8n is currently dominating the agent landscape

, though actual adoption of agentic platforms in 2025 has been slow.

A whopping 92.4% of respondents report at least one significant downsides to using AI tools.

There’s definitely room for improvement.

AI is far from the novelty it was a year or two ago. It has clearly cemented a place as work and productivity infrastructure, and AI tools are improving at a breathtaking pace. If AI is already giving most people back at least half a day per week in late 2025, what does 2026 look like? What about 2027?

We’re watching the early innings of a compounding productivity revolution.

As Kevin Weil (VP at OpenAI) noted

,

“The AI model that you’re using today is the worst AI model you will ever use for the rest of your life.”

What exactly AI is doing for people, function by function

PMs

are seeing the most value from AI tools to (1)

write PRDs

(21.5%), (2)

create mockups/prototypes

(19.8%), and (3)

improve their communication

across emails and presentations (18.5%).

Prototyping, at #2, signals one of many role-boundary shifts happening now. With tools like Lovable, v0, and others, PMs are increasingly going from idea to prototype without waiting on design.

But look farther down the list and a pattern emerges: AI is helping PMs

produce

, but it lags in helping them

think

. The top jobs are all production tasks (docs, prototypes, comms), while strategic and discovery work sits near the bottom (

user research

at 4.7%,

roadmap ideas

at 1.1%). PMs have cracked how to use AI for the “last mile” of getting ideas out of their head, but they still have a big opportunity to embrace AI for the upstream work of figuring out what to build.

Designers

are finding AI most helpful with

user research synthesis

(22.3%),

content and copy

(17.4%), and

design concepts ideation

(16.5%).

Visual design ranks #8, at just 3.3%.

AI is helping designers with everything

around

design (research synthesis, copy, ideation), but pushing pixels remains stubbornly human. Meanwhile, compare prototyping: PMs have it at #2 (19.8%), while designers have it at #4 (13.2%). AI is unlocking skills for PMs

outside

of their core work (at least in the case of prototyping), whereas designers aren’t seeing the marginal improvement benefits from AI doing their core work.

Founders

lean heavily toward

productivity and decision support

(32.9%),

product ideation

(19.6%), and

vision/strategy

(19.1%).

Unlike others, founders are using AI to

think

, not just to produce.

The top three jobs are all

strategic

:

decision support

,

ideation

, and

vision/strategy

. That’s a stark contrast to PMs (whose top jobs are documents and prototypes) and designers (research synthesis and copy). And look at that #1 category: “productivity/decision support,” at 32.9%, is unlike anything else in the survey. No other role has a single use case this dominant. Founders are treating AI as a thought partner and sounding board, not just a tool for specific deliverables. (This tracks with

Tal’s excellent post on building AI copilots as long-term thinking partners

and Amir’s recent post on

building your second brain using ChatGPT

.)

The surprise misses: Financial modeling

sits at just 1.8%, despite founders living in spreadsheets during fundraising. Same with

recruiting

, at 1.3%, even though hiring consumes enormous founder time. These feel like opportunities waiting for better tools.

This pattern may explain why founders report the highest satisfaction throughout the survey—they’ve figured out how to use AI for higher-leverage strategic work, not just production tasks.

Engineers are the outlier.

For them, AI is doing just one big job:

writing code

, the core engineering task. Whereas for the PMs and designers, AI is helping them with supporting work.

Farther down the list are jobs like

documentation

(7.7%),

testing

(6.2%), and

code review

(4.3%). These are the “boring but necessary” tasks engineers typically dislike. As you’ll see in the opportunities data below, that’s about to change. Engineers have accepted AI as a coding partner; now they want it to handle the tedious work that comes after the code has been written.

One more pattern worth noting: engineers report the most mixed results on quality later in the survey (51% better but 21% worse, the highest “worse” of any role).

Engineers are the only role where ChatGPT isn’t #1

ChatGPT is the #1 most popular AI tool for most roles

: 57.7% of PMs, 49.6% of designers, and 72.1% (!!!) of founders use ChatGPT over any other AI tool, with Claude coming in second for those three roles.

But engineers have a very different behavior.

GitHub Copilot was first to market, has Microsoft and GitHub’s distribution muscle, and is baked into the world’s most popular code repository. Yet it sits behind three tools that launched after it. Engineers are choosing newer (better) alternatives over the incumbent.

For engineers, the top three are in a dead heat:

Cursor

(33.2%),

ChatGPT

(30.8%), and

Claude Code

(29.0%) are all within 4 percentage points. This market hasn’t consolidated, and switching costs are low. Also notable: Claude Code (29.0%) outpaces Claude’s chat interface (20.7%). Purpose-built tools are winning, but Claude is also helpful with several core coding-related tasks (e.g. code migration and

more

) that put it at fourth.

Gemini

sits at a distant 10.6%, but a caveat: this space shifts

fast

. A few strong model releases or product updates could reshape these rankings quickly. What’s true today may look very different in six months.

ChatGPT

is a far-and-away winner for PMs.

Perplexity

is also surprisingly highly ranked, probably due to its strong research capabilities.

However, farther down the list,

Lovable

(8.7%) and

Cursor

(7.7%) are cracking the top seven for PMs. This reinforces the pattern we saw earlier: PMs are increasingly building things themselves, encroaching on what’s traditionally design and engineering work. The PM toolkit is expanding beyond documents and decks.

One note:

Copilot

(8.4%) edges out

Cursor

(7.7%) among PMs, though the reverse is true for engineers. This may reflect Microsoft ecosystem lock-in at larger companies, or simply that PMs discovered Copilot first and haven’t yet explored alternatives.

AI is driving significant time

and

quality gains (for most)

63% of PMs and 83% of founders report that AI saves 4+ hours per week.

Even the most skeptical group, designers, still shows 47.5% reporting 4+ hours saved. Only 1% to 5% of respondents across roles say AI is “no faster than manual work.”

On quality, though, the story is more nuanced. PMs and founders are bullish (over 70% report quality improvements), but engineers are more mixed.

51% of engineers tell us that AI makes the quality of their work better, but 21% say it’s worse.

Designers fall in between, at 60% better, 13% worse. The quality ratings among engineers may reflect the higher bar for correctness in code: a “somewhat better” first draft of a PRD is useful; a “somewhat better” but buggy function is not. Also, bad code is easier to spot than a bad PRD.

Where are the opportunities for more AI help?

The gap between where people are using AI today and where they

want

to use it next reveals a lot about where the opportunities are for founders and startups to jump in and deliver new tools and functions.

For PMs, the biggest opportunity story is

research

.

User research shows the largest demand gap of any task (+27.2pp). Only 4.7% say it’s their primary AI use case today, but nearly a third want it to be. The pattern is clear: PMs have figured out how to use AI for output tasks like writing PRDs and drafting communications, but they’re hungry to apply it upstream, to the messy work of understanding

what

to build.

Prototyping is a breakout category.

For PMs, “

creating mockups/prototypes

” jumps from 19.8% (currently using) to 44.4% (want to use next), a +24.6pp swing that makes it the single most-wanted future use case. For designers, prototyping and interaction design show similar momentum (+27.8pp). This tracks with the rise of tools like Lovable, v0, Replit, and Figma Make: people have seen what’s possible and want more.

Engineers are shifting their use of AI to handle work

after

writing the code.

Writing code was by far their most popular use case (51% current), but it has a demand gap of only +5.6pp. However,

documentation

(+25.8pp),

code review

(+24.5pp), and

writing tests

(+23.5pp) all show massive opportunities for growth in engineering AI tooling.

Founders are doubling down on AI as a thinking partner. Product ideation

shows massive demand, jumping from 19.6% (currently using) to 48.6% (want to use next), a +29.0pp gap.

Growth strategy and GTM planning

(+24.7pp) and

market analysis

(+24.0pp) follow close behind.

Founders already use AI heavily for personal productivity (32.9% currently), but they want to move upstream. They’re looking for a strategic collaborator to pressure-test ideas, explore markets, and think through go-to-market—AI as a

co-founder

,

not just an assistant.

Based on these reported gaps, the next wave of AI adoption will require not just better models but better workflows for human-AI collaboration on fuzzy problems. Writing a PRD has a clear output; competitive research does not. Writing code can be tested; “product ideation” cannot.

Which AI tools have product-market fit?

We asked: “Which AI tool(s) would you be very disappointed to lose access to?” The classic Sean Ellis PMF question. 83.6% named at least one tool, which is itself a remarkable signal of how embedded AI has become in daily workflows. But the relationship between the number of people who regularly use a tool and would miss that tool if it went away tells the story of the products that have truly found product-market fit.

ChatGPT dominates, perhaps only for now.

Half of respondents (50.2%) would be very disappointed to lose ChatGPT, but that’s notably lower than the 60% to 75% of respondents across most roles who say they regularly use the tool. This, in part, explains why OpenAI recently declared a “Code Red” as it watches Gemini and Claude begin to erode market share. Switching costs in AI are still very low.

ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini top the list for PMs—they’re such multi-purpose tools well-suited to the PM job.

It’s most interesting to see Cursor right behind Gemini (we wouldn’t expect an engineering tool like Cursor to be so popular among PMs), followed by Lovable (which currently seems to be winning in the prototyping market).

Designers (23.3%) and founders (20.6%) index highest on Claude. The Claude ecosystem (Claude and Claude Code combined) reaches 27.5% overall. This feels like a big win for Anthropic.

Specialized engineering tools have found loyal users and a clear product-market fit among engineers.

For engineers, the PMF leaderboard looks completely different from everyone else:

ChatGPT

(25.3%),

Cursor

(20.7%),

Claude Code

(17.1%), and

Claude

(13.4%). Three of the top four products they’d miss are coding-specific tools. Engineers have found—and want to hold onto—specialized tools that fit their needs, rather than relying on general-purpose chat interfaces. Cursor’s 20.7% PMF among engineers (vs. 7% to 9% for other roles) shows how deeply it has embedded into coding workflows.

In fact, a handful of role-specific tools are winning their niches.",https://www.lennysnewsletter.com

Someone smarter than me once said,

“AI won’t replace you, but a person using AI better than you might.”

I believe this is exactly right. Right now, we all need to be building the skills that help us become that person using AI better. Lucky for us, Amir Klein is already that person and has written a guide for the rest of us. Though it’s targeted at product managers, the advice and workflows can be implemented by anyone in any function. Thank you, Amir, for giving us a glimpse into the future and the concrete steps to get there.

The first month in my new role at monday.com, I was tasked with building our first AI agent. The goal was to create an AI co-pilot, something users could turn to for insights, explanations, or building complex workflows they wouldn’t know how to create on their own. To build that, I needed a ton of context—all the internal knowledge, decisions, assumptions, and scattered inputs that shape any product direction. And gathering all of that felt completely overwhelming.

I was drowning.

All that context lives everywhere: Slack channels, Notion pages, Monday boards, decks, Google Docs. Hundreds of tiny fragments I could never quite piece together. I kept running into mental blocks, forgetting what I knew from where, and getting stuck. Instead of trying to keep all of that context in my head like I always had, this time I wanted to try something new. I dumped everything I had into a ChatGPT Project, word-vomited all that was on my mind, and asked if it could help me get started. And boy, did it.

Finally, I felt like I could smell a roadmap on the horizon, a direction was forming, and things began to click. Even better, I felt

somewhat

in control without being stressed about storing everything in my head. I could store it in the AI instead—a second brain. Instead of all that information overloading my own brain and pulling my attention in a hundred different directions, I could finally focus on the product work I love and need to get right to be successful: understanding the problem, shaping the vision, and building something meaningful.

My good friend Tal taught us

how to think with AI

. I’m building on Tal’s post by showing what happens when AI becomes an extension of your mind—when it carries your context, grows alongside you, and ultimately amplifies what you’re capable of as a PM.

Context is important—but comes with a heavy mental load

No matter

what

we’re doing, we’re constantly trying to hold way too much information in our heads. I always imagine it like carrying a giant basket filled with random things like eggs, water bottles, watermelons, toy cars, a cactus (I hope you’re picturing a Dr. Seuss scene). And I’m on the go, so things are rocking all around the basket, and more things keep being added, and then an egg falls and cracks, one of the water bottles starts to spill over, a toy car keeps banging into one of the watermelons . . . basically anxiety in a metaphor.

That’s what it feels like trying to hold all the context required to do product work. But the hardest part isn’t just

carrying

it; it’s that none of these pieces arrive neatly fitted together. Context comes in fragments: user feedback, metrics, market changes, internal constraints, past decisions, intuition. As PMs, our job is to assemble those pieces into a clear picture—shaping the problem, forming the hypothesis, and defining the solution space.

When you can pull that together, you build products that solve real problems so well that customers change habits for them, pay for them, and genuinely feel the impact. But doing that synthesis in your head, and doing it over and over again, can literally feel impossible.

That’s where AI comes in. When you feed in all of that context that you’ve been trying to juggle yourself, your ChatGPT Project becomes a second brain that can store the information and synthesize it for you. That means that it can know and retrieve the right piece of data for the right problem—like an instantaneous librarian—and even use what it knows to run analyses and generate recommendations, like an associate PM.

It’s important to say: using a second brain doesn’t dull your role but actually sharpens it. Your reasoning, product sense, knowledge, and taste are still doing the real work; AI just amplifies them. You can’t outsource judgment or creativity. This isn’t AI thinking instead of you—it’s you thinking with more clarity because all the mental overhead is gone. You still make every decision; the second brain just clears the path from your insight to the output.

Step 1: Create its personality

If someone were to ask you, “Hey, do you want a really smart, eager, motivated, capable person by your side who knows what you know and is super-enthusiastic to tackle anything you want?” you’d probably say yes in a heartbeat. Well, you’re in luck, because that’s exactly what Projects can be.

At monday.com, I had all of this information (my ever-growing basket) that I was in dire need to create a plan from. So I turned to ChatGPT, opened a Project, and got started. Cue the music.

If you’re trying this yourself, Projects live in ChatGPT’s left sidebar under “New project.”

(I’ll share how to do the same thing in Claude and Gemini later on.)

Once you’re inside, if you approach Projects like a second brain that you’re growing, you want to first make sure it thinks in the way you think. In other words, you need to build its personality. Each Project has an instructions section where you can first define this “personality” in plain language.

A really awesome way of doing this is with the help of ChatGPT (of course). Open a new chat and describe what you want. For example:

I’m a Monday PM working on AI agents. I’m building a ChatGPT Project to be my thought partner, something that’ll work with me on my initiatives, something that’ll know how to challenge me in all the right places, push back on areas that feel weak, and creatively think of alternatives with me. This Project’s “personality” has to be sharp, smart, fun, and not always agreeing with everything I come up with. It also needs to be a pro at product management—this includes product sense and product execution, with a strong sense for product taste and delight. Can you help me write the instructions for this project? :) Cheers!

It’ll output instructions for what you want:

Tweak what you want or just copy the whole thing as is into the instructions page, and your second brain is now eagerly waiting for you to feed it information!

Step 2: Feed it information

Now comes the fun and legitimately relieving part: feeding it all that context that you are barely holding onto. Go to “Add files” and just dump it in.

I think the biggest “whoa” moment for me is realizing that

everything

is essentially text. The classics, like PRDs and docs, are a given, but decks, websites, Excel/CSV sheets, dashboards, and Slack channels all contain text too. They just need to be exported into PDFs and then you can upload them into the files section too.

Once you see everything as text, you start to understand how much context you can actually give your second brain. Here’s what that looks like in practice:

I’ll scroll through a massive Slack channel that’s gotten impossible to navigate. I’ll export it or, if that’s not possible, I’ll copy and paste the entire channel’s contents into a doc and save it as a PDF. Then I drop it into the Project. Now ChatGPT knows what has already been discussed, what decisions were made, and what issues keep resurfacing.

When I need it to understand our product’s capabilities, instead of rambling on to it about how my product works, I go to our support or docs site, hit Command + P, and save the entire page as a PDF to drop in. That way, whenever I mention a feature, my second brain already knows how it works.

I do the same with research data like transcripts, interviews, surveys, CSVs. Everything becomes fuel. Each file adds depth to the brain.

In the case of the first initiative I led at monday.com, I started with a few decks that different colleagues of mine had made, downloaded PDFs of monday.com documentation pages explaining how specific things work, and added a bunch of CSV files containing Reddit threads of conversations thousands of people had about monday.com in relation to AI and our competitors. This was enough to get the ball rolling and start formulating a plan. The beauty of Projects is that you’ll start creating new artifacts from it. Whatever it is you’re creating—whether it be PRDs, overview docs, or strategy decks—once finished, you can take those, put them in a doc, download them, and feed them back into your second brain. Each new thread you open will be up to date with you on your work. It becomes a living thing.

This is what my Project ended up containing after hundreds of threads:

Step 3: Let it cook

There’s no one specific thing to use Projects for. As your second brain becomes more and more knowledgeable about your work, you can lean on it for everything that you don’t want to do but needs to get done. For example:

1. Sign-up forms

I needed to create a sign-up form for users to get early access to the agent we were building. This is a classic case of something that seems pretty easy at first but ends up making you bang your head against a wall. How should I phrase what I want to ask? How do I make the output from the form clear and purposeful for me without making filling out the form exhausting for users? Your second brain can now swoop in to save the day as it holds all the context on your initiative. In this case, I asked:

I’m sending out a form to users to sign up for a waitlist for our first agent. I want to put 2-3 questions on the form which gauges their expectation to ensure we’re aligned on what we’re building and to receive another level of verification around the pain point. These questions should be concise, and the user’s answer will be open-ended (free text).

My sign-up form looked like this:

There are endless posts and podcasts about how investors pick startups. But Lenny and I were curious about a quiet class of employees who seem just as good as—if not better than—the most famous VCs at spotting generational companies before they blow up.

How do these rare folks keep joining world-changing companies before most of the world even notices them?

To find out, we interviewed five people whose resumes include some of Silicon Valley’s most remarkable companies:

Palantir

,

OpenAI

,

Facebook

,

Stripe

,

Linear

,

Figma

,

Notion

,

Slack

,

Box

,

Spotify

, and

Dropbox

.

Each joined at least two of these companies early—an extraordinary feat, especially since they committed as full-time employees, not diversified investors. Their “hit rate” is phenomenal.

We were curious: What did they see? How did they choose? Are there lessons to take from their experiences?

Across their stories, we saw three distinct factors that mattered most.

Though originally written for job seekers, these insights apply much more broadly—for founders, investors, or anyone trying to recognize greatness early.

Here’s what to look for.

1. Ambition bordering on “ludicrous”

This was the most novel takeaway for us: One of the clearest markers of a future generational company, according to our interviewees, is

ambition

. It came up again and again.

Bob pointed out that “

both Palantir and OpenAI were considered ludicrous when the companies were first started.

Joining Palantir in particular seemed like a very risky proposition. But actually it wasn’t risky at all. If the company failed, at worst, I’d wasted a year of my life and would have to go back to my PhD. But if the company succeeded, it would be life-changing.”

Soleio “was surprised by the

ferocity

and

ambition

of the early Facebook team. They all seemed too smart to be working on ‘social networking’ but had a lofty idea for where the internet was ultimately headed and how Facebook might completely reshape it.”

Sean added, “If a company’s thesis is marked by

extraordinary

ambition

, it’s probably worth paying attention.”

“The key tell,” Bob said, “was always the

ambition of the goal.

”

Rasmus explained, “The logic here is simple: If everyone says, ‘Yes, that’s clearly a great idea, and you have direct competitors on day one, you are definitely late to the game. Even if you excel and go above and beyond expectations, the chance of making a meaningful difference in this world is small-ish. However, if someone has sailed across the sea of exploration, waded through the bog of research, and is still going on about an idea, there’s a small chance that they are ahead of the rest of us and see something I’ve yet to see.”

How to judge ambition

What are signs that the founder’s ambition is big enough?

The founder sounds a bit crazy.

Sean shared, “For Meter, to start from scratch to make your own hardware across many platforms . . . it really indicated that this company is taking a huge swing. Or they’re just

crazy

. Along those same lines, when I met Dylan Field [CEO and co-founder of Figma] on a bus to a developer conference in 2013, he was just starting Figma. I remember talking to him about what he was building, what he wanted to do with it, and how it seemed

completely insane

to do in the browser. It was clear Dylan was not going to stop, no matter what, and we know how that has gone.”

People laugh at them.

Rasmus recalled, “Spotify, a little group of ‘nobodies’ in Sweden, said, ‘Let’s build a catalog of all the music in the world and give everyone access.’ People

laughed at us

—I mean that literally, as in record-label officials

laughing at Daniel

[Ek, CEO and co-founder], asking them to give us a chance. The key here was that businesspeople thought it was a bad, bonkers idea while friends thought it sounded like a perfect future.”

No one has ever attempted this idea before.

Rasmus added, “It may be a bit of a cliché at this point, but

if

no one else is trying to do what a company is trying to change in this world, then there might be something interesting going on

,

especially if it’s ambitious.”

To close, in the words of Bob, “At one point at Palantir, [co-founder and CEO Alex] Karp said, ‘

We want Palantir to be the most important company in the world

, not the most valuable one. But if it’s really important, it’s going to be valuable too.’”

2. Founders, founders, founders

Building on the above insight, every interviewee emphasized the same point: the founders matter above all else. Not as one variable among many—this was

the

variable.

Cristina (early Stripe, Notion, Linear) said it outright: “

The founders (and early team)—nothing matters more than this to me.

I’m going to work hard, and I want to win, but I want to do it with people whom I want to see win too. When I joined Stripe, I joined more because I thought the people were special. I had more conviction about the company itself later.”

Sean (early Slack, Box, Meter) echoed her: “

Quality (and authenticity) of founders

have always been the most important variable to me.”

Rasmus (early Spotify, Figma, Dropbox) distilled it even further: “

People and mission.

Who and why (not as much ‘how’).”

Bob (early Palantir, OpenAI) added, “The common pattern was an incredibly

ambitious goal combined with a credible team.”

There’s that ambition again.

How to judge founders

Joining a company with great founders is easy to say and hard to do. What exactly makes a founder great? Many people call out intelligence, and we have a whole section highlighting the importance of ambition. But our interviewees mentioned some less obvious traits.

1.

Ability to adapt

Bob pointed out that “both Palantir and OpenAI started with an unworkable initial strategy that perhaps the world was correct to mock. But both iterated over time to something that worked.

It’s more important to be able to learn quickly than to have a good strategy.

”

Cristina shared the same sentiment: “It’s so difficult to build a company, and there’s so much you need to learn going from one stage to the next and scaling.

Founders who truly love to learn and look at company-building as a learning experience are quite predictive of whether founders will build durable, special companies.

I remember saying early on at Stripe that Patrick and John [Collison, co-founders] didn’t just want to build a great product; they wanted to build a great company. And in looking back, I remember their apartment had books piled to the ceiling—they knew so much about so many different topics, and they always sought advice from others. They had a learning mindset, and I think they still do.”

Sean described this as “

rate of change

.”

Soleio called it “

clock speed

,” adding, “The common thread I’ve observed with all of these companies is how fast they operated and how extraordinarily capable their early employees were. Are they building their ideas in real time or does it take months to see their visions crystallize in software?”

2.

Ferocity

Rasmus looked for “clear

passion

from the people who are ‘the company.’ Passionate and interesting people have been a core aspect of my professional life.”

Cristina said she “loved Ivan’s [Zhao, founder and CEO of Notion]

intensity

” and has always been drawn to “intensity plus intelligence.”

And as you’ll recall from above, Soleio “was surprised by the

ferocity

and

ambition

of the early Facebook team.”

3.

Founder-market fit

Sean always asked himself, “Do these people seem like they’re doing what they’re meant to be doing, and is there no question that no one else can do it as well as them?”

Bob was optimistic about Palantir’s chances because

“

it was founded to take the ideas behind the analysis software that solved fraud at PayPal and apply them to the intelligence community.”

To close, in the words of Cristina: “If the three most important things in real estate are location, location, location,

the three most important things in startups are people, people, people

.”

3. Judging today’s product is a trap

You’d think that for legendary product companies like Stripe, Figma, Slack, Notion, and Facebook, you could tell how special they were going to be by how good their early product was. It turns out this way of thinking is a trap.

Soleio said that when he first logged in to Facebook, “

I remember being disappointed

. The version their team had described was light-years ahead of what I saw that day.” Likewise, Figma was

more prototype than product

the day Dylan laid out his vision to me for building a collaborative design platform.”

Cristina had a similar perspective: “Many of the companies I’ve joined were developer products or products that were meant for teams, so I couldn’t truly try the product myself, as I’m not a developer or didn’t have a team use case for it. So in general,

I discount my own thoughts about a product in those cases.

”

Sean told us that

“in the earliest days of Slack, it was rough around the edges

.

To quote Stewart [Butterfield, co-founder],

it was a giant piece of shit

.

The bulk of the vision was there in that beta period from 2013 to 2014, but still awaiting refinement.”

Rasmus rightly pointed out, “

Almost every product I’ve worked on started out as one thing but was something quite different at the time of consumer success.

Spotify was going to be a video streaming platform and Figma a meme generator.” So even if the product is great, it may have to radically change anyway.

to the

Lenny’s Newsletter Product Pass

🎉

All annual Lenny’s Newsletter subscribers now get one full year’s worth of PostHog Scale

and

2x the free-tier credits, a $16,500 value.

This deal is available to

all

annual subscribers, and brings the total value of the

Product Pass

to

over $25,000

. Simply absurd.

Subscribe

This is the first time PostHog has ever offered a deal like this, and you won’t find it anywhere else. Like all Product Pass deals, you must be a new PostHog customer to take advantage of the deal. See

Product Pass terms here

.

PostHog helps you build successful products by giving you literally every piece of SaaS that you need:

analytics

,

experimentation

,

feature flags

,

session replay

,

error tracking

,

data warehouse

,

LLM analytics,

surveys

, and

more

—all in one platform. In the words of the founders, “We keep adding new capabilities at a pace that’s borderline unreasonable.”

The all-in-one platform strategy that PostHog is executing is really interesting to me. I rarely see it done this well, because it’s hard to do. But if you pull it off—like they are—you can build a generational business. Being able to follow an issue from a session recording, to its impact in analytics, to shipping a fix as a feature flag, to testing a variant, to collecting feedback with surveys—that’s the holy grail.

Side note: I stupidly had a chance to invest in PostHog early on and passed because I didn’t think this strategy would work 🤦.  I’m just happy to get to work with them on this collaboration now.

Oh, they also just launched

PostHog AI

, which integrates with all of the products and lets you ask questions about your data, magically create dashboards, build surveys  using natural language, summarize session replays, and more.

More how-to videos here

.

In addition to all the wonderful products PostHog offers, there’s so much to love about how the PostHog team operates:

Their

website

is 🤌

Their

story

is inspiring.

Their

are hilarious.

Their

company blog

is one of the most genuinely useful and high-signal-to-noise company blogs out there. A model for how to do content marketing. Some examples:

I’ve consistently underestimated how important communication is as a CEO

How we got our first 1,000 users

How to do startup sales with no experience

Job interview questions engineers should ask (but don’t)

How not to be boring

Over 300,000 companies use PostHog, including 65% of every YC batch, Lovable, Supabase, ElevenLabs, and even Y Combinator itself.

Twice the free credits gives you tons of room to scale (90% of their users never exceed their already-generous free tier), and the Scale add-on gives you all the features you need to grow: priority support, white labeling, unlimited projects, HIPAA BAA, SAML, SSO + advanced permissions, audit logs, extended session replay retention, and more.

this link

to get a free 6-to-9-month supply of replacement HEPA bags. Their team sent me a unit to try out when they were just getting started, and I loved it so much I’ve been telling everyone about it.

Living Tea seasonal tea club

:

A friend got this for me, and it’s so nice. They include background on each tea, how to best steep them, and all kinds of extras that make the experience feel special.

These stainless-steel infusers

are really handy (especially if you’re wary of tea bags these days). We also love

Leaves and Flowers

and

Rishi

teas.

Koshi chimes

:

The sound of these is unique and delightful. “Simply move the chime gently holding it by its cord to produce a crystalline, relaxing sound that mesmerizes and calms.”

Plant-based desk lamp

:

You may have noticed one of these in my podcast background. We bought it at the West Coast Craft fair in SF, but they also sell them at

SFMOMA

. I don’t recommend the ones with legs, though, as they tend to come off.

These are also cute

. As are

these classic Noguchi lamps

.

Microplastic-free salt. After learning that I was

half-man, half-plastic

and also that sea salt is one of the most microplastic-laden foods one can consume (

thanks, Huberman

🥴), we discovered this product (through

marketplace), and it’s now our go-to salt. Pretty, healthy, and yummy. Pairs well with this plastic-free

Klean Kanteen

water bottle (which is not as fun as other bottles but easy to clean).

They come with guides to help you learn, and they are really high-quality. My wife and I even practice on it while we’re playing with our son because we’re both learning piano.

Yoto mini player

:

A neat screen-free audio player for kids. Our son loves his so much. He rotates between the Beatles, Raffi, Queen, and Spanish

cards

while he walks around dancing, listening to it (rather than staring at a screen). How can you not love that? Sir Paul McCartney and Chan Zuckerberg Ventures are investors, to encourage more screen-free entertainment options for kids. Many people love the

Belkin MagSafe 3-in-1 charger

:

I saw these at a hotel once, immediately got it, and love it. Better than any other nightstand charger I’ve tried.

Herschel tech backpack

:

This has been my go-to bag for years.

Sony WH-1000XM5 noise-canceling wireless headphones

I learned about this from

Kevin Rose’s newsletter

. There’s also

an Anker version

, but I like this one better.

Hooga amber book light

I’m always on the lookout for alpha to share with you on what the most successful companies are doing differently—so you can do it as well. This post is the epitome of that.

Emily Kramer

has identified a pattern in how top AI (and non-AI) startups are able to break through the noise and grow unlike at any other time in history. Once you see it, you immediately rethink your growth strategy. I did! After reading the first draft of this post, I got a whole new level of understanding for why my

product pass

has been such a success (fun fact: it doubled my growth, and is the most win-win-win idea I’ve ever concocted).

Below, Emily shares how you can implement this strategy yourself, along with dozens of real-world examples of how top companies are executing it. For more insights from Emily, check out her excellent

You’ve built something great. Maybe even shipped it faster than you thought possible, thanks to AI. But here’s the catch: everyone else has that same speed advantage.

So you turn to distribution. But here’s the second catch: the B2B channels you’ve long relied on for growth are increasingly becoming less effective, for that same reason.

Inbound:

Search traffic is declining due to LLMs, and social is flooded with derivative content.

Outbound:

With AI SDRs and easier access to contact data, everyone’s inboxes are overflowing.

Product virality:

We’re overwhelmed with new products (thanks, AI!), so with endless choice, virality is much harder to achieve.

Events:

While people crave authentic connection in the AI and hybrid-work era, the explosion of trade shows, micro-conferences, and webinars of mixed quality has led to event fatigue.

Lifecycle emails:

With inboxes saturated with cold outbound, even lifecycle emails focused on driving engagement and retention get tuned out.

So in this new competitive, AI-driven landscape, how do you get your great product noticed?

The answer is

ecosystem

. Instead of going directly to your prospects, go through intermediaries who already have access and trust with your audience.

Tom Orbach

, the director of growth marketing at Wiz, said it best: “Why start at zero when you can start at 10,000?”

You’re likely familiar with the individual tactics within an ecosystem strategy: influencer and creator relationships, channel partnerships, developer relations, communities, product integrations, and customer marketing. But the growth unlock doesn’t come from any one of these activities on their own.

Instead, a flywheel emerges when you properly implement this overarching strategy: your ecosystem partners create and distribute content, you amplify and repurpose their efforts, together you drive greater reach and credibility, new customers and partners come on board, and the cycle strengthens with each turn. Now your ecosystem is a powerful extension of your GTM team.

Ecosystem is a force multiplier

and

differentiator

When you look at the fastest-growing companies today, you probably see AI-first companies known for their lean teams and great products. But I see something else: companies that wouldn’t have achieved these growth trajectories without their ecosystems.

Supabase

The Postgres development platform and database became the default backend for vibe-coding products like Lovable. As these companies grew, so did Supabase. In addition to these “integration” partners, Supabase’s open source community shared docs, tutorials, and videos, further driving growth and building credibility.

→

Supabase went from 1 million to over 4.5 million

developers in under a year, which would not have been possible without two sets of ecosystem players: the open source community and the awareness from integration partners.

“Community and virality aren’t ‘intangible.’ Supabase shows how to turn organic pull (GitHub stars, YC adoption, vibe-coding buzz) from developers into structured funnels, lifecycle paths, and monetization.” —

Aaron Cort, operating partner at Craft Ventures, investors in Supabase

Clay

Clay grows through close partnerships with “GTM engineer” power users—consultants, agencies, and in-house operators. These Clay creators make videos and tutorials that drive adoption and awareness.

→ Without this creator ecosystem showing what’s possible, Clay’s flexibility could have been a liability instead of an advantage.

Lovable

Lovable helps builders quickly create apps that are naturally shareable—a classic driver of viral growth (think “Built with Webflow” or “Made in Typeform” badges). But Lovable accelerates this virality through community-driven initiatives like

hackathons

and their

Discord, which just surpassed 100,000 members

.

→ Lovable’s product is excellent, but there are many other vibe-coding products out there. Lovable’s investment in building a brand alongside their creators has catapulted them above the rest.

“For years, the marketing playbook was predictable, but not anymore. All the attention has shifted to the creator economy.

The goal is no longer to produce everything in-house but to empower creators to generate content about you

,

and then repurpose it across paid and organic.” —

Elena Verna, head of growth at Lovable

Gamma

Gamma built an ecosystem of micro-influencers across TikTok, Instagram, X, and LinkedIn to show off presentations built with Gamma’s AI design tool. They paid them not just to post but offered a bonus for virality. They also extensively catalogued successful hooks and formats to make this scale.

→ Gamma attributes

over half of their growth

to influencers, and founder Grant Lee breaks down

the details in this post

.

Vercel

Vercel’s huge developer community builds on

Next.js

(which Vercel leads work on), and those projects naturally scale into Vercel enterprise deals.

→ Without the Next.js ecosystem and community contributions, Vercel likely never would have had the credibility or reach to move upmarket.

ElevenLabs

ElevenLabs

turned users into contributors through its Voice Library. Voice actors upload voices and earn money when they’re used, which attracts more creators. These voices also power viral content like “

AI presidents

” on YouTube and TikTok. Viral hits drive press coverage, too.

→

ElevenLabs hit $100 million ARR with just 50 employees

. Without its paid creator ecosystem (over

$1 million to creators in 2025

), the product itself would have fewer voices and it wouldn’t have spread as quickly.

You’ll see ecosystem flywheels behind nearly every fast-growing AI startup, from

Baseten

’s strategic partnerships with cloud providers, to

Midjourney

embedding its product in Discord from day one, to

Anthropic

building

MCP

to make it easier for developers to connect tools and data to Claude and other LLMs.

Why ecosystem works

I initially became obsessed with the power of ecosystems firsthand at

Carta

in 2018, where lawyers as channel partners drove massive growth, and at Astro in 2017, where building for the Slack platform led to

Slack acquiring Astro, in its largest acquisition at the time

. Back then, these plays felt like outliers. But today, this strategy is essential. An ecosystem is fast becoming the rule for growth, not an exception.

Here’s why:

1. Your ecosystem makes every channel more effective

The best reason to invest in an ecosystem is that, when done well, it makes every channel better by serving as both a distribution path and a source of content.

Ecosystem partners fuel inbound, add value and credibility to your outbound messages, accelerate product virality, make events more enticing, and ground lifecycle marketing in real use cases.

Example: HubSpot partnered with a bunch of marketing influencers

to promote their new framework, “Loop Marketing,”

when they announced it at their Inbound conference this year. This combination spurred lots of discussion, driving a bunch of organic Linkedin posts too. All of these efforts came together to make it feel like the Loop Marketing framework was everywhere that week (at least if you were a B2B marketer).

2. Your ecosystem knows how to speak to your audience (maybe better than you do)

AI has made it easy to pump out content, making it harder than ever for people to know who and what to trust. This means they are turning to voices they already value and respect (like Substack writers!). Ecosystem players like these already know how to speak to your audience. Your brand simply can’t build that trust overnight—if ever—without these partners.

You see this especially on LinkedIn, where individual people (employees, customers, or partners) perform much better than brands—eight times better from employees vs. brands, according to

LinkedIn

.

Example: Vanta may be best known for its clever

play-on-words billboards

, but you’ve likely also seen them sponsoring business Substacks (like Lenny’s) or podcasts. Since their product centers on trust, it’s smart to partner with high-trust creators who their (compliance-minded) audience already knows. It’s clear that a significant share of their paid spend now goes not just to billboards but to creators too. Fun fact: Vanta is one of Lenny’s top 3 podcast sponsors.

3. GTM teams are smaller now and need leverage

AI was supposed to make GTM teams more efficient—and in some ways it has. But

shrinking

GTM teams are scrambling to get efficiency through AI while also finding creative, compelling ways to differentiate.

Your ecosystem is an accelerant for a lean team, like bringing on a contracted team of expert marketers. Working with partners, customers, and communities may not be as turnkey as paid search, for instance, but with the right workflows (and a boost from AI), the ROI can be extremely high.

Example:

Navattic

built a team of marketing advisors, which makes the team seem much larger than it is. They set up long-term or advisory arrangements with micro-influencers who get early access to products, give product feedback, and also regularly post on LinkedIn as part of the relationship.

4. You have a ton of options within an ecosystem strategy

Ecosystems aren’t limited to products you integrate with or creators with big LinkedIn followings. And if one ecosystem partner starts showing diminishing returns, you aren’t out of luck. There’s a broad network of individuals and companies that can reach your audience.

If a person or company, no matter the size or reach, has spent time building up the audience you want, you can figure out how to work with them.

Example: If you have a niche audience, you can often find organizations and trade associations to partner with.

Clio

works with state bar associations to reach lawyers, and

Upstart

has long been a preferred partner with the

NAFCU

, a regional credit union trade association.

How to implement an ecosystem strategy

Growth strategies are never one-size-fits-all, but most B2B startups today can grow faster with a well-designed ecosystem strategy. With audience attention fragmented and harder than ever to earn—and startups hitting revenue milestones faster—you can’t afford

not

to leverage the people, companies, and platforms that already have your audience’s trust.

Because there are so many types of partners and ways to collaborate, there’s opportunity here for nearly every company.

The question isn’t

if

you should build an ecosystem strategy, it’s

who

your best partners are,

how

to activate them specifically, and

how

to reshape your team and process to prioritize that work.",https://www.lennysnewsletter.com

1.

Lovable

What it is

Not only the fastest-growing company in history ($100 million ARR just eight months after launch, faster than Cursor 🤯), Lovable is an AI-powered vibe-coding platform that enables anyone to build apps and websites by chatting with AI. PMs can turn sketches, screenshots, and ideas into live interactive prototypes. Designers can refine the UX inline. Engineers review the code in their GitHub repos. As of last month, Lovable includes cloud and AI features that allow you to build AI-native, full-stack apps with zero configuration or tedious work required.

Why I love it

Whenever I’m vibe coding something, I try a bunch of the tools in parallel. Lovable has been producing the best stuff for me lately.

What I use it for

A bunch of personal use cases. I built

a YouTube preview tool

,

a YouTube thumbnail downloader

,

a strikethrough text tool for X

, and

a tool to download all of the images inside a Google Doc

. So fun!

How other people are using it

Product teams: turning PRDs or screenshots into live, interactive prototypes to validate ideas

Marketing teams: launching landing pages; turning customer collateral into interactive websites with trackable CTAs

Sales teams: building ROI dashboards that quantify product value

Finance teams: taking FP&A out of spreadsheets and into live, easy-to-use dashboards

Here’s a fun directory

of what people have built with Lovable.

2.

Bolt

What it is

Also one of the fastest-growing companies in history (0 to $40 million ARR in five months 🤯), Bolt is an enterprise-grade AI-powered vibe-coding platform that helps PMs, founders, and designers turn ideas into fully functional prototypes using AI and natural language—no code required. Bolt is used by 72% of Fortune 500 product teams, and even allows you to build using your company’s native design system.

Why I love it

What makes Bolt unique in my mind is that, unlike other popular vibe-coding platforms, which rely on their own homegrown agents, Bolt integrates with state-of-the-art frontier agents, like Claude Code (with OpenAI Codex and Gemini CLI), so you always get access to the most advanced coding agents, without switching tools. In other words, if you love Claude Code, you’ll love Bolt.

What I use it for

Also a bunch of personal use cases.

A feed of the latest AI news (updated daily)

,

a dial of how stressed I am based on workload that I can share with my wife

,

a simple app to tell me if my son needs a jacket at school today

, and

a tool to learn basic Spanish

.

How other people are using it

3.

Granola

What it is

An AI notepad designed for people in lots of Zoom/Teams/Meet meetings (i.e. everyone). As you take notes, it silently transcribes everything said in the background. Once the meeting is complete, Granola enhances your notes, summarizing what everyone said, and makes it easy to share (and search) what was said. Best of all, Granola doesn’t join your calls. Instead, it works behind the scenes using your laptop audio. There’s an iPhone app for in-person meetings and phone calls too.

Why I love it

I was blown away by both the UX and the quality of the notes it generates. You can use it to quickly share meeting notes with colleagues, recall decisions you’ve made in past meetings, analyze themes over time, and even

notice when you’re avoiding conflict (with help from Claude Code)

. The product is so thoughtfully designed in every way, and everyone I introduce it to gets hooked. It’s quickly become the obvious-tool-to-use for AI meeting note-taking.

What I use it for

Every single meeting I have.

How other people are using it

Linear’s CEO uses Granola to stay focused

Intercom’s founder uses it to stay on top of all his meetings

Getting coached in the style of a top CEO coach

Searching for something someone said in any of your meetings

ChatPRD

What it is

An AI platform built specifically for product managers. It writes product specs, standardizes your documents across your team, and integrates with the best-in-class PM tools, including other product-pass products like Lovable, Bolt, Gamma, Magic Patterns, and Linear. It’s especially great at taking raw ideas, turning them into clear PRDs, and then sharing that with your favorite vibe-coding tool.

Why I love it

There’s no other AI tool out there that’s this laser-focused on both making PMs’ lives better

and

helping everyone else on the team play PM.

It’s also

a first-class citizen in Linear

now, meaning you can use it to improve task descriptions, break down work into actionable sub-issues, and get product feedback (by simply mentioning @chatprd in comments).

Neat

.

What I use it for

Since I’m not building products with teams these days, I don’t use ChatPRD much, but I’ve heard nothing but rave reviews of it from readers. And having worked closely with

Claire Vo

on

her pod

, the

Lenny & Friends Summit

, and all kinds of other side projects, I know anything she builds will be top-notch.

Since turning 40, I’ve felt a lot less invincible. For the first time in my life, my annual bloodwork results weren’t 100% healthy. A few months ago, I broke my pinkie toe on the edge of a wall. Last month, I sprained my wrist trying to adjust an A/C unit. Last week, I banged up my knee after slipping on a staircase.

Then I took a toxins screen and learned I’m half-man, half-plastic:

So over the past year I’ve started getting serious about my health: tracking my nutrition, exercising, experimenting with supplements, focusing on my sleep, etc. Along that journey, I came across

Justin Mares

.

Unlike the health folks everyone knows—Andrew Huberman, Rhonda Patrick, Bryan Johnson—

Justin

is a full-time builder. He co-founded

Kettle & Fire

,

Perfect Keto

,

Surely

, and now

Truemed

, and he’s basically a health nerd who spends hundreds of hours researching what to buy for himself and his family and shares what he learns in blog posts and tweets. When I decide what products to buy and which brands to trust, I’ve found myself

constantly

referencing his recommendations, more than anyone else’s.

But I’ve always wanted more. So I pitched Justin on putting together a comprehensive and specific list of his favorite products and brands—the safest, least toxic, and highest-quality products he himself buys for clothing, sleep, food, toxin mitigation, and more. This is what you’ll find below.

And as a bonus, at the end of the post, we’ve compiled a handy bullet-list summary of every product and brand mentioned.

Note, except for a couple that Justin explicitly calls out, neither Justin nor I is an investor in any of these companies, and there are no affiliate deals involved. This is just a well-meaning post to help you all live a long, healthy life . . . so that you can keep building beloved products for many years to come.

A huge thank-you to Justin for spending endless hours compiling this list. I will be referencing it

frequently

In 2011, I was working for my first company while also taking a full college course load. As a committed Tim Ferriss acolyte, I read a blog post about polyphasic sleep. For a whole month, I slept 3.5 hours a night and took a 20-minute nap every four hours, even if that meant leaving class or coming late to a fraternity party.

This was insane. After a month of polyphasic sleep—and two crash-outs where I slept 18 hours in a row to recover—I realized it wasn’t for me. But what

was

for me, and what I’ve mostly stuck to in the 14 years since, is the paleo diet, which I decided to do after reading about it in the same blog post.

I went paleo for two weeks my junior year of college (yes, I was the weird kid who would pass on the pizza and beer). And during this two-week experiment, my acne disappeared, I got leaner, slept better, and just had more energy.

As it turns out, what you put in your body affects how you feel! If you’re not healthy, you’re not able to perform at your best, period. This is why so many in Silicon Valley are so obsessed with sleep tracking, diet, and other tools to help improve performance at work.

Unfortunately, the West is in the

throes of a chronic disease crisis

. Americans today are the sickest population of humans to ever exist. Nearly 50% of adults have prediabetes or diabetes, 73% are obese or overweight, and the richest American men

live 15 years longer

than the poorest, almost entirely due to chronic disease burden. Diabetes alone has an economic cost of around

$106 billion

.

In this post, I won’t cover traditional health tips (exercise, get eight hours of sleep, etc.), though they’re crucial. Instead, I want to cover some of the lesser-known health gotchas that consistently sap your health. I’ve spent the past decade of my career building companies in this world: first with

Kettle & Fire

(now a $100M+ annual revenue brand) and now with

Truemed

. And I’ve spent hundreds (thousands?) of hours searching for products that are the most effective both at driving real health outcomes and at avoiding many of the common toxins, microplastics, and other unhealthy compounds we encounter on a daily basis. Here are my most recommended products:

Sleep

Getting good sleep is among the most critical things you can do to improve your health and set yourself up for peak work performance. There’s a ton of literature on why sleep is so important, but for the purposes of this post I’ll assume you’re already a believer.

In my view, the 80/20 of sleep health boils down to three things:

Exercise during the day

Get morning sunlight

Optimize your sleep setup (no external light, quiet, low CO

2

, cold) as much as possible

Beyond the basics, I’ve found a few products that really help me get my best sleep. I love my

Eight Sleep

, and have found their pod works

incredibly

well to help me both increase my deep sleep and avoid wake-ups. For those who have trouble falling and staying asleep, magnesium

has been shown

to radically improve sleep quality. I think the

Momentous magnesium L-threonate

supplement is the best out there. If you’re really, really struggling to get to sleep, I have a few friends who swear by the peptide Epitalon . . . though it’s technically a research chemical, so I can’t point you anywhere to get it. Ask your doctor. Or buy it illegally online, but beware of sourcing!

Studies have found that

mattresses can be a source of harmful chemicals

(especially foam ones), as they emit phthalates, benzophenones, and other compounds that have been linked to asthma, developmental issues, and reproductive harm. Sadly, many of these chemicals have not been thoroughly tested (thanks to

the insane way we regulate chemicals in the U.S.

), but the few studies we do have are concerning.

You may or may not know this, but our current approach to chemical regulation relies on industries to run their own tests and make their own assertions that the novel, never-before-seen chemicals they’re inventing and putting in our products are safe and sound.

When a pharma company invents a drug that humans take, it goes through a rigorous FDA approval process that takes a decade and is tested for safety. When a chemical company invents a compound that your body can’t break down and ends up in food, the water supply, and our bodies, regulators require . . . nearly nothing. How does this make sense?

It gets worse! That’s our approach to

new

chemicals. But for the chemicals there

have

been safety testing for—the thousands that we know are harmful at some dose but where the dose makes the poison—how are exposure limits determined?

To determine exposure limits, scientists follow a relatively simple process. First, they’ll expose a lab animal, often a rat, to small amounts of said chemical. They’ll then sit and watch for behavioral changes: Does the rat slow down, look like it’s in pain, or start wobbling a bit?

They then continue to increase the dosing of the suspected toxin until they observe behavioral changes in the rat. At that point, they take the dose they exposed the rat to and multiply it by a “safety factor” (usually 100) to account for the difference in weight between rats and humans. And that’s it. Anything below the dose number that’s spit out is now considered . . . safe!

To ensure you’re not inhaling toxic compounds that mattresses often off-gas (like VOCs, benzene, and formaldehyde) while sleeping, I highly recommend the

Woolshire pillow

, the

Avocado

mattress and pillows, and

Coyuchi sheets

. Besides Avocado, I have heard good things about

Essentia

and

Naturepedic

. And lastly, if you have $80,000 burning a hole in your pocket, I’m sure you can’t go wrong buying

Hästens

(though I wouldn’t know). Apparently, Drake bought eight of these mattresses for his Toronto home.

Clothing

Your skin is the largest organ in your body, and it consistently absorbs compounds and chemicals that it’s exposed to. Yet we rarely think about what’s in the clothes we spend nearly all our time wearing.

Even though many clothes use dyes and chemicals known to be hazardous, there’s no such thing as a nutrition label, or even a disclaimer, as to what might be in the clothes you put on your body.

Turning fibers into clothing is a complicated and chemically intensive process. Thousands of chemicals are used to make clothing, some 10% of which have been shown to

disrupt the immune system, increase cancer risk, mess with hormones, and create reproductive issues

. Even worse, the fun, stretchy performance fabrics you love to wear probably have the highest level of chemical treatment, and heavily utilize PFAS (forever chemicals) and PBDEs (chemicals used as flame retardants). This could be one reason why PFAS are

found in 97%

of Americans’ blood.

It’s unfortunately not just the chemicals, dyes, and other additives that make your clothing choices important for your health. Extremely common materials like polyester can

lower sperm count

, yet it’s by far the most popular material used in underwear. These fabrics, and the dyes and chemicals on them, can fairly easily enter the body, especially in areas where your skin is most permeable: your nether regions, feet, and armpits.

I strongly recommend

at minimum

wearing toxin-free, organic cotton or linen socks and underwear. My favorite brands are

Industry of All Nations

and

Pact

for underwear (

Nads

as runner-up), and Pact for socks.

For shirts, I like

Paka

’s stuff, especially their T-shirts, as they use a blend of 85% organic cotton and 15% alpaca fibers.

Faherty

has a surprisingly good selection of organic tees that I’m into. And lastly—though I probably shouldn’t share my secrets—

Wax London

is my go-to fashionable brand that has tons of organic options.

Food

This is the area I feel most passionate about. The Standard American Diet (SAD) is terrible. Right now, many Americans get 55% of their calories from

ultraprocessed foods

. The typical American diet is often bereft of nutrients, is riddled with toxins, and has created the sickest population of humans to ever exist on this planet 🇺🇲.

In large part, this is because we have a food system that is uniquely permissive in what it allows in our foods. Worse, international companies (like Mondelez) actually have

American versions of the same product

, where the American version is simply more processed!

When it comes to sourcing foods, the biggest things to optimize for are (1) nutrient density and (2) toxin avoidance. The most nutrient-dense foods are sourced more locally, which inherently means eating seasonally. The farther your food travels, the less nutrient-dense it is. One study found that after nine days of travel, spinach was

90% less nutrient-dense

than it was at harvest. Here in Austin, I am fortunate to live near an amazing grocery store (

Radius

), but many major cities have excellent farmers markets or grocery stores to buy local.

Beyond nutrient density, it’s important to mitigate common toxins like pesticides (glyphosate, atrazine), phthalates, microplastics (though it’s nearly impossible), and PFAS. That means buying organic where possible—especially the most-sprayed fruits and vegetables, called the “

dirty dozen

”—and, again, buying whole, unprocessed foods that require fewer chemicals to ensure some amount of shelf life. There are certifications (like glyphosate-free) that are fairly good signs that you’re buying from a brand that cares about sourcing, but these are few and far between.

Beyond those principles, there are a few foods from companies I feel comfortable recommending:

Protein bars/snacks:

I absolutely love these

Maui Nui meat sticks

. Maui Nui has the best-sourced meat I am aware of, anywhere in the world. (We partnered with them at Kettle & Fire.) They actually hunt and harvest the animals they make the jerky from, and it shows in the taste and nutrient density of their meat sticks. It should be no surprise, but when animals live a longer time, forage, exercise, and are outside for their natural lifetimes, well, they tend to be more nutrient-dense and protein-rich: exactly what Maui Nui products are.

I prefer these sticks to a protein bar most of the time. But if I’m running low, I absolutely love the

Jacob bar

in a pinch. Just be sure to

avoid David bar

. 😉

Bone broth:

You probably knew I would say this, but I drink at least a carton of

Kettle & Fire

bone broth each day. We made the first

wild-harvested bone broth

(with Maui Nui), which is my go-to. But all our flavors are good!

Beef:

People should be eating far more organ meats, because they’re such a great source of key amino acids and other nutrients. I love Force of Nature and their

ancestral blend

, which makes it easy to get organ meats in your diet while also buying some of the highest-quality regenerative beef out there.

White Oak Pastures

also does an incredible job from a sourcing standpoint.

Coffee:

This is a tough one to source locally. I buy a lot of coffee from the

Groundwork

team, who have worked hard to build one of the only regenerative coffee supply chains in the world. Bonus points if you want to stir in some

$400 manuka honey

(which is apparently lightly psychoactive, though I haven’t personally tried it).

At this point in my life, there are very few national food brands that I support, as I tend to prefer buying locally and seasonally where possible. Scaling a food business while maintaining high standards is extremely difficult, and, to be frank, most companies out there don’t do a good job. Even Whole Foods’s beef

has a high degree of phthalates!

Supplements

Many supplements are a waste of time and money. Much (most?) of what you’ll find on Amazon is probably fake, overhyped, or doesn’t have enough effective ingredients to do anything. A recent consumer test found that 4 of 6 creatine gummy brands

contained no creatine

at all!

For almost everyone, getting core nutrients and amino acids from whole food sources is

far

superior to getting them from supplements. That said, many folks are still missing some of the building blocks the body requires to thrive. That’s where supplements can come in, to . . .

supplement

the diet. Some I like and recommend:

Protein powder:

Protein is key, and most Americans don’t get anywhere close to the recommended 0.36 grams per pound of body weight. For those looking to increase protein intake,

Equip

is probably my favorite protein powder, with the

Momentous whey

a close second. I would recommend avoiding plant protein powders, as they (1) basically don’t work and are

not bioavailable

, and (2) are often made from pea or soybean protein, which is among the most pesticide-sprayed crops out there. For example, a

Mamavation test

found Orgain’s organic pea protein powder had glyphosate levels roughly

1,000 times

higher than recommended.

Beyond protein for building muscle, Americans also criminally underconsume collagen and gelatin, both of which are key building blocks for healthy joints, skin, hair, and gut. I have four or five servings of collagen per week (on top of my daily bone broth) and recommend the collagen from Equip, Momentous,

Lineage

, and a company I started years ago,

Perfect Keto

(if you want the extra boost that comes with coconut fats).

Creatine:

Creatine is a naturally occurring amino acid stored in muscles and the brain that helps with energy creation. It’s been safely used by bodybuilders since time immemorial and is increasingly associated with a host of

mental performance benefits

. Pretty much the only creatine I would buy is

Momentous

, as they are one of the only non-Chinese-sourced brands out there.

Nattokinase:

This is a new compound that I am very bullish on. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., and 70% to 80% of heart attacks are caused by atherosclerotic plaque. Certain dosages of nattokinase (at least 10,000 fibrinolytic units) were found to be more effective than statins at reducing arterial plaque, a significant contributor to

heart

disease

. For the many folks whose labs show high cholesterol or concerning ApoB/Lp(a) markers, I think taking nattokinase preventively is a good idea. I’ve been taking

Toku

, which has the clinically effective dose plus vitamin K2 (I also invested in the company). A friend

found recently

that his ApoB dropped 16% and his LDL came down 20% after 60 days of taking Toku. Josh (the founder of Levels)

found similarly

!

B vitamins and MTHFR:

If you’re like me—and 30% of other people—you may have some variety of the MTHFR mutation. This mutation impairs the body’s ability to detox and can lead to higher levels of homocysteine, an amino acid in the blood that, at elevated levels, is linked to increased risks of heart disease, blood clots, strokes, and cognitive decline. I take this

B complex

from Thorne daily to help with methylation (basically, how your body clears toxins) and give my body support to detox and function the way it should.

Organ supplementation:

As I’ve mentioned, organ meats and connective tissue contain key amino acids and nutrients that are not found in muscle meats like steak or chicken breast. Unfortunately, most Americans primarily eat cuts of muscle meats, and thus don’t get many key amino acids in their diets. I get it: eating straight kidney and liver can be gross! Many people (aka me) prefer supplementing with organs in capsule form. My favorite

organ supplement

is from Maui Nui (a partner of my company Kettle & Fire), which I believe sources the best and most ethical animal protein in the world.

Outside of those daily staples, I have a whole host of supplements I’ll take for specific life events, often from brands like Momentous or Thorne, which both have good sourcing practices. For example, when I’m sick, I follow the

Huberman protocol

and take 600 to 900 milligrams of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), along with 100 mg of zinc, per day for three to five days. I take

AHCC

and

astaxanthin

to help my body fight off the infection. I also mega-dose vitamin C and try to spend at least 30 minutes in the sauna.

Though this regimen seems to help, nothing is better than not getting sick at all. That’s why whenever I fly, I use

Viraldine

before getting on the plane to prevent catching anything (including feelings).

Toxin mitigation

In my view, environmental toxins are the trans fats of our generation.

PFAS

, phthalates, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, pesticides, and heavy metals are everywhere. They’re in your clothing, detergents, soap, shampoo, paint, furniture, water, and air. As of this writing, 92% of Americans have measurable phthalates in their body and 97% have PFAS in their blood. These chemicals have been shown to affect

testosterone levels

,

anxiety

,

cancer risk

, and even

sperm count

.

Some researchers believe

that they even have a role to play in the fact that girls are hitting puberty one to two years sooner than they were 40 years ago.

In large part, we are here because the FDA has totally dropped the ball on regulating new chemicals. The European Union, on the other hand, takes a “do no harm” approach and assumes that new chemicals may cause harm. So they regulate them! The EU currently bans more than 1,300 chemicals and compounds that the U.S. allows.

The FDA takes the opposite approach: Sure, humans have never before been exposed to these classes of chemicals, but whatever—let’s assume they’re safe. The U.S. has over 40,000 chemicals allowed in our food, water, and environment, with minimal pushback from the FDA. Between this and the 50 years it took the FDA to act on

the whole trans fats thing

(and then, only after multiple lawsuits were brought against them), I think it’s safe to say that the FDA’s approach to chemical regulation has lots of room for improvement.

Anyway, back to toxins. They’re everywhere (in breast milk, our blood, our urine), have tremendous health impacts, and are highly likely causing many of the chronic conditions that plague Americans today.

Detoxing your environment is critically important but almost impossible to do completely. That’s why I think an 80/20 approach makes a lot of sense here: cut out toxins in the things you’re regularly exposed to, and use detox tools (like sauna, or fancy new blood cleaning approaches like

Inuspheresis

/

Proxima

) to attack the remaining 20%.

For many, this means cleaning up your home environment, your office environment, and your kitchen. Most of what I’ve learned about this I learned after having the

Lightwork

(think: functional medicine doctor for your house) team do a thorough test and review of my home.

Here are the things I’d buy to mitigate toxin exposure in all of those spaces:

Air purifiers:

Most microplastics are inhaled, not ingested via water or food. On the high end, I like the

Jaspr

, but if you’re looking for a great everyday purifier, the

PuroAir

is also quite good.",https://www.lennysnewsletter.com

Ever since

my chat with Dan Shipper

, I couldn’t stop thinking about his hot take that

Claude Code

was the most underrated AI tool for non-technical people. A few weeks ago, I finally started playing around with it, and holy sh*t, we’ve all been sleeping on Claude Code.

The key is to forget that it’s called Claude Code and instead think of it as Claude

Local

or Claude

Agent

.

It’s essentially a super-intelligent AI running locally, able to do stuff directly on your computer—from organizing your files and folders to enhancing image quality, brainstorming domain names, summarizing customer calls, creating Linear tickets, and, as you’ll see below,

so much more

.

Since it’s running locally, it can handle huge files, run much longer than the cloud-based Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini chatbots, and it’s fast and versatile. Claude Code is basically Claude with even more powers.

To inspire your own ideas, I’ve collected 50 of my favorite and most creative ways non-technical people are using Claude Code in their work and life. This list includes my own favorite use cases, and the best examples y’all shared with me on

X

and

LinkedIn

of how you use Claude Code.

A huge thank-you to the more than 500 of you who shared your stories. 🙏

But first, let’s install Claude Code on your computer

Open your Terminal app

On a Mac, press

Command (⌘) + Space

, type

“Terminal”

, and hit

Return

In Windows, press

Windows key + R

, type

“wt”

, and press

Enter

Install Claude Code

On a Mac, run this command:

curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

In Windows, run this command:

irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex

Launch Claude Code:

claude

If you run into any trouble, just ask your favorite chatbot for help. Or better yet, install

Warp

(

free with your newsletter subscription

!), which replaces your local terminal app and automagically solves any issues you encounter trying to install stuff like Claude Code. That’s how I solved the problems I ran into, and I highly recommend you do the same.

Five ways I’ve been using Claude Code this month

1. Clearing space on my computer

Prompt: “

How can I clear some storage on my computer?

” I then discuss my options.

2. Improving the image quality of screenshots

Prompt: “

Improve the image quality of [filename]

”. I used this many times for the screenshots below.

3. Downloading YouTube videos

Prompt: “

Download this YouTube video: [URL]

”. Then I ignored all the warnings 🤫

4. Downloading all of the images embedded inside a Google Doc

Prompt: “

Download all of the images in high-res from this Google Doc: [URL]”.

This paired well with item #2.

5. Picking a random raffle winner from a Google Sheet of submissions

Prompt: “

Pick a random row from this Google Sheet to select a winner for a giveaway.

” I used this for a recent Sora 2 giveaway in our subscriber Slack community.

50 creative ways non-technical people are using Claude Code

Out of the over 500 ideas you shared with me on

X

and

LinkedIn

, here are my favorites (with screenshots):

1. Brainstorming domain names, from

Ben Aiad

“Just describe your project, and it’ll suggest creative options across multiple TLDs (.com, .io, .dev, etc.) while verifying what’s actually available to register.”

2. Finding high-quality leads, from

Jeff Lindquist

“I literally just typed: look at what I’m building and identify the top 5 companies in my area that would be good for a pilot for this. Then I go to LinkedIn and message them. If it’s not clear, I do this in the source directory of the code of my app so the first thing it does is figure out what it is that I’m building.”

3. Same as above, but instead, scraping GitHub repos, from

Sergei Zotov

“My product masks sensitive data in code assistant queries. So Claude Code proposed the idea to find potential leads in the GitHub repos, by searching for the actual sensitive values in them (and whether in the repo we see some evidence of using coding agents). This was actually genius—not only does it filter out a lot of companies, but it also provides instant value to the lead. Here’s what it came up with: repos list, priority score, even LinkedIn URL.”

4. Noticing when you’re avoiding conflict, from

Dan Shipper

“I download all of my meeting recordings, put them in a folder, and ask Claude Code to tell me all of the times I’ve subtly avoided conflict.”

Pro tip: Use

Granola

(

first year free

!), and ask Claude Code how to download your meeting notes into a folder.

5. Figuring out why your computer is running slow, from

Anthony Roux

“I sometimes use Claude Code for system diagnostics when my Mac slows down.

I use it to check load averages, memory pressure, disk space, stuck processes, and swap activity, then it dives deeper to find what’s actually causing issues. It can calculate cache sizes, check Docker usage, find Time Machine snapshots eating space, etc.

It is usually faster and more user-friendly than running all the commands and trying to extract the right numbers myself. It can explain what the analyses mean and why they matter, and suggests fixes with the actual commands while assessing the risk of running each of them.”

6. Cleaning up messy invoice files, from

Martin Merschroth

“I use Claude Code to sort my invoices for taxes. It reads each file in a messy folder, renames it to ‘YYYY-MM-DD Vendor - Invoice - ProductOrService.pdf’, and moves it into the right folder.”

7. Organizing files and folders across your computer, from

Justin Dielmann

“For me, staying organized is a huge chore. The cognitive load of figuring out where to store files and keeping everything clean and up to date was insane. My hack: I run Claude Code from my home directory and use it as my personal organization assistant. I’ll ask it things like:

‘Find duplicate files and help me decide which to keep’

‘Organize these downloads into proper folders’

‘Review my directory structure and suggest improvements’

‘Find old files I probably don’t need anymore’

It’s like having a thoughtful assistant who actually understands context and can make smart decisions about file organization. Game changer for reducing mental clutter.”

8. Building a slide for your child, from

John Conneely

“I built my own DIY subagent last week to help me build a slide tower for my son 😀”

The finished product:

9. Organizing scattered thoughts, from

Helen Lee Kupp

“I’m a mom who voice-records ideas during morning stroller walks, not a developer. The terminal interface? Overwhelming at first. The word ‘Code’ . . . but what if I don’t have a ‘coding project’? After 3 weeks of struggling to organize my scattered thoughts, I tried it anyway. And discovered something wild: Claude Code isn’t about coding at all. It’s about having an AI that manages your entire process—whatever the goal might be.

How I use it:

→ Fed it rambling voice notes from stroller walks

→ It organized them into coherent research themes

→ Wrote a full article in

my

exact voice (pulled from my own examples!)

→ Created LinkedIn versions automatically (this post is one of them!)

→ Everything saved and ready to publish (including grabbing a screenshot of the template repository that I’m adding here!)” [

Here’s the repo

]

10. Writing a job description, from

Justin Bleuel

“I used it to generate a full job description, hiring plan, interview plan, and rubric for a new role at Clay.

I made a folder with internal Notions of our hiring material for PMs, added similar role JDs from other companies, then in planning mode asked to generate the same collateral for this new role.”

11. Synthesizing transcripts of calls with customers, from

Derek DeHart

“My current Claude Code jam is synthesizing transcripts of calls with customers to compile evidence that supports or invalidates a running tally of assumptions/requirements/hypotheses/whatever. Given MCPs to interact with other tools in our productivity stack—Fireflies, Linear, Notion, etc.—it’s become my hub for ongoing product research and development.”

12. Improving your writing, from

Teresa Torres

“I now write all of my content with Claude Code in VS Code. We iterate on an outline, it helps me improve the hook, it conducts research for me and adds citations to my outline, and it reviews and gives feedback on each section as I write. It has completely changed the way I write.” [

Much more on Teresa’s process here

]

13. Working with audio files, from

Dan Heller

“I’m working with multiple audio files. I use Claude Code to manipulate them, convert the sample rates, rename them, and translate them from Portuguese to English.”

14. Creating “self-driving” documentation, from

James Pember

“The most interesting use case we’re playing with is something I call ‘self-driving documentation.’ Basically, how can we give an Agent the responsibility of figuring out how/where our documentation can be better and more comprehensive. We’ve been experimenting with using Claude Code together with

Playwright

to automatically explore our software independently, identify knowledge gaps in our documentation, and then create those changes itself. Very promising!” [

More here

]

15. Creating a self-improving feedback loop, from

Gang Rui

“I created a slash command that analyzes my journal entries + Git commits (for the past 7 days; usually I use this weekly), spots gaps between what I said vs. did, and suggests system improvements. Like having a COO that learns from my patterns.”

16. Getting inspiration from competitors’ ads, from

Sumant Subrahmanya

“Extract ads from competitors to find the problem, use case, or copy/asset that’s working for them, and then repurpose it for my ads. Claude Code built out these scripts that would screen-grab all ads running on the ad library, and it’s super cool to watch it navigate to the browser and grab all screenshots in an almost ‘agentic’ way.”

17. Automatically creating changelogs, from

Manik Aggarwal

“I use Claude Code to create user-facing changelogs. I ask Claude Code to scan all commits from a specific time period, then pull in my changelog guidelines. It drafts a clean, structured changelog that usually needs few quick edits. What earlier took me hours is now down to 10–15 minutes. Most of our changelog output is created with Claude Code, with a final polish done by me.”

18. Building presentations, from

Hank Yeomans

“All my slide work is done in Claude Code as HTML, then imported into PPT.

First, I make a couple of slides that I need with some simple but well-prompted data, while also prompting to create them as html pages. Otherwise they might get created as SVGs or ‘slop AI images.’ I work with Claude Code making any adjustments.

When I get it the way I want it, I ask Claude Code to make a template that I can use to ensure all future slides added are the same format, branding, look, and feel.

This template becomes an .md file (I’ve put a snippet of that file below). With html you can be extremely specific—‘change this wording to say that’—and then you can use an MCP to view the ‘slides’ to show what you mean as well for greater context. With this, I have added several more slides as well as changed others using the template to keep things the same. Yes, hallucinations happen, that has to be accepted going in. Someone who knows what they want and can articulate what they want will not have too much trouble.

When I want to put these into PPT, I just do well-thought-out screenshots. But honestly, If I’m using these for a customer or some presentation, I just open a browser and I have ‘previous’ and ‘next’ buttons built into them so that I can click through. Claude Code creates these as interactive html ‘slides’ so they react to the mouse.”

And there’s much more in store in the coming months.

What is Devin

Devin is an autonomous AI engineer. You assign it bugs, features, or complex refactors through Slack, Linear, Jira, or its website. It writes the code, then sends you a pull request to review.

Tens of thousands of people are using Devin in production today, including top teams at Ramp, Nubank, Goldman Sachs, Citi, and Microsoft.

Why I love Devin

It’s the most widely deployed enterprise-ready AI engineer on the market, and every forward-thinking builder I know who’s used Devin absolutely loves it:

Claire Vo

told me that Devin is the #2 contributor to her six-figure

ChatPRD

business (behind only her, for now) and touches 100% of their PRs, by reviewing code, updating documentation, or writing all of the code.

Here’s Claire’s interview with Devin co-creator Scott Wu

.

Sahil Lavingia

has been proudly sharing that Devin is

Gumroad

’s #1 contributor of code, with over 1,500 merged PRs (averaging 10 per day).

Dan Shipper

said, “Working with Devin is familiar because it feels like adding a few junior engineers to your team. You toss them tasks, and they’ll get started with enthusiasm . . . It’s programming leverage—it’s productivity power.”

Here’s Dan’s chat with Scott Wu

comparing Devin to Claude Code.

Devin ranks #1 in the

Builder Arena

, ahead of Cursor, Lovable, Replit, and Figma Make—a benchmark based on thousands of people blindly comparing the output of each AI’s product being given the same prompt.

Also,

Scott Wu

(CEO of

Cognition

) is something else:

How you might use Devin

Most people use Devin to take on their bugs and feature requests, but you can work with Devin to:

Scope new roadmap ideas

Update UI and add visual polish to your site

Handle QA on product changes

Keep internal documentation up to date

Take a first pass at data analysis requests

Take on the most tedious items on your backlog

Build SaaS integrations

Send daily summaries of shipped changes

Tackle complex migrations:

Nubank

used Devin to migrate their over-6-million-line ETL monolith over the course of a couple of weeks, which otherwise would have been an 18-month and 1,000-engineer project.

Increase your unit test coverage:

Litera

used Devin to increase their test coverage by 40%, which reduced their regression cycles from three weeks to two days.

Most people begin with Devin as an AI software engineer, handing off well-scoped software engineering tasks. They then expand into QA, product, analytics, and CX.

The goal is to take on all of the lower-level work so that you have more time to focus on figuring out

what

to build and how to get it into the hands of users.

If feedback is a gift, why is it so hard to receive? And to give.

It’s because no one taught us how to give feedback.

I was introduced to

Jack Cohen

by (frequent collaborator)

Tal Raviv

, who told me, “Jack is the single biggest influence on my personal productivity and ‘inner game.’ ” Over the past 11 years, Jack has coached hundreds of founders, executives, and managers to help them grow themselves and their colleagues as fast as their startups.

Growth hinges on getting honest and ongoing feedback. Through thousands of feedback conversations and hundreds of hours of research, Jack’s developed an evidence-based, immediately applicable framework for giving feedback that he calls

GAIN

. As Jack puts it, “GAIN is both a useful acronym and the core of the philosophy.” When you tell people what they

stand to gain from the feedback, it suddenly starts feeling like a gift again.

This guide is essentially a how-to for Radical Candor, and the most specific (and easy-to-remember) framework for giving great feedback that you’ll find anywhere. It’s going to blow your mind. Enjoy.

For more, Jack teaches a highly rated course,

ManagerGPT: The AI Tools and Human Systems to Scale Yourself and Your Team Fast

, focused on helping high-growth leaders build their individual operating systems and interpersonal skills to stop fighting fires (or each other) and start creating what matters most: great products and great teams. For a taste of the course and a demo of both GAIN feedback and the AI tool Jack built to support it, check out his free 30-minute lightning lesson, “

FeedbackGPT: Give Feedback People Thank You For

.”

Over my past 11 years coaching several hundred people from dozens of organizations and teaching thousands more, there’s one challenge I’ve seen people struggle with across every level, industry, company stage, personality type, and culture: giving feedback.

Many people come to coaching and workshops already describing themselves as “conflict-averse,” dreading having difficult conversations and giving direct feedback. A good number arrive fed up with failed attempts to get people to change their behavior, with many missing the irony as they bemoan, “I keep giving them the same feedback, and

they

never change. Maybe they just don’t want to.”

What these folks miss is their own power to catalyze change by shifting the framing and approach of the feedback they give.

I’ve seen and felt firsthand the difference between the “feedback masters” and “feedback disasters.” After every feedback conversation from one colleague who I had initially respected, I felt deflated. As a result, everything suffered: our product, our relationship, and my overall well-being.

Later, I worked with another colleague whose feedback left me elated every time (actually!). I couldn’t wait for meetings with her because I enjoyed them so much and I knew that her feedback would help even my best work reach another level.

On reflection, I realized that the content of the feedback from these two colleagues was strikingly similar, but the way my second colleague framed and delivered hers lifted me up instead of shutting me down.

That difference answered an age-old question: How on earth do you get someone to change or grow? And how can you do that in ways that strengthen your connection instead of breaking it? By mastering the art (and science) of giving great feedback.

The good news is that this is a learnable skill—and one that is core to my work as an executive coach and organizational behavior consultant.

On a daily basis, I give feedback to clients and help them give feedback to their colleagues, as well as establish effective feedback systems across their teams and organizations.

At my company, we also practice this in almost every meeting, and the growth it elicits is remarkable. One colleague said that after regularly getting and giving feedback using the GAIN framework, he felt “much more driven by purpose, rather than by fear.”

So what is the difference between the feedback masters and disasters? How can you shift your framing and approach to ensure that the feedback you offer inspires people to take action and keep growing? My experience, informed by a wealth of research from multiple fields, shows that effective feedback shares several key qualities:

I call this feedback approach the

GAIN framework

. GAIN is both a useful acronym for remembering these essential ingredients in effective feedback and the core of the philosophy.

It is profoundly more effective and inspiring to frame feedback based on the experiences or results we want to move toward (the

gain

) instead of focusing only on what we want to move away from (the

pain

).

We can often do this in just a few short sentences. Say an engineering lead is frustrated with a PM’s sloppy handoffs and the resulting delays. The engineering lead’s feedback to the PM might sound like: “I want us to reduce handoff friction so we can ship faster. The last handoff meeting we had, you didn’t share any background customer research, which I failed to flag at the time. Lacking that context led to multiple rounds of engineers pinging you with questions instead of making empowered decisions on their own. Can you include that next time?”

The challenge is that feedback doesn’t typically show up in our brains in such a crisply articulated, ready-for-prime-time state. It might start as “Product just threw this over the wall; they don’t care about our time.” Or “They’re lazy; they always do this!” It takes some translating to get our raw reactions into a form that’s more likely to have the desired impact (the “gain”). That form must include:

What both parties ultimately care about (the

G

oal)

What needs to change to get there (the

A

ctions)

Why (the

I

mpacts)

Who

will do

what

by

when

to start making progress (

N

ext actions)

Thinking through the GAIN elements is a powerful way to understand and channel those raw reactions constructively. This often starts by using your feelings as a clarifying signal pointing to what you really care about, which should inform your Goal for the conversation. In cases where your feelings are particularly strong or unwieldy, preparation that’s even more focused on your “inner game” (a topic for a different post) becomes an essential step in leveraging the GAIN framework.

Especially with complex or sensitive topics, including each of these GAIN elements in the conversation—often, but not always, in order—leads to greater receptivity and, consequently, more behavior change and more satisfying results.

Once my clients understand how GAIN works, they see the ways they themselves have been unintentionally eliciting defensiveness and resistance and how, very practically, they can flip that on its head.

One founder said, “GAIN helped me have structured conversations that have proven to be successful especially with ‘fragile’ team members. I’ve done this successfully with more than five people in just the past two weeks.”

Another client, startup veteran

Brian Martin

, described his experience this way: “After I gave feedback once or twice in this new way and saw people actually listen and change and drive the business results or the behavior that I was trying to help them toward, I was like, ‘This is great. I can do this.’ It created a positive feedback loop, and now it’s something I just do that I think people really appreciate about me.”

As Brian notes, people start to realize that the function of feedback isn’t just for behavior change. When shared with skill and engaged with vulnerability, a substantive feedback conversation builds immense trust, meaningful connection, and deep gratitude. (For example,

many

guests

on Lenny’s Podcast and beyond rave about that exact impact that Sheryl Sandberg’s feedback had on them and their relationship with her.)

This post will help you build confidence, fluidity, and effectiveness in giving feedback that people end up thanking you for.

I’ll walk through a real scenario from a client who applied the framework within a challenging interpersonal context (with a micromanaging founder), explaining each “move” she makes. Then I’ll review phrases and principles you can use, and wrap up with three ways AI can help you prepare and master feedback.

But first, where did GAIN come from?

Why GAIN? The evidence behind the framework

GAIN represents the convergence of principles that I encountered in research across over a dozen diverse domains, ranging from couples therapy to decision-making to workplace collaboration to teaching, all focused on how to inspire enduring behavior change.

They all orient to the same thesis: Communicating what we all want more of (the gain) is more effective than communicating what we want less of (the pain). They don’t say that speaking about pain is bad, just that it’s helpful to contextualize it as the gap between where we are and where we want to be.

First, let’s look at communication in the most sensitive domain: marriage. Watching just three minutes of a conversation, marriage researcher

John Gottman

was able to predict with 93% accuracy which couples would be happy, distressed, or divorced six years down the road; most people, even couples therapists, averaged

50% accuracy

. How does Gottman distinguish the relationship masters from the disasters? His meticulous research, filming couples’ conflicts and tracking the couples over years, shows that couples with long-term happy, stable relationships open conflict conversations with more positive and less negative emotions than doomed ones, especially

focusing on sharing the “dream within the conflict.” Instead of just complaining, they articulate what it is they want more of and why (the

Goal

in GAIN)

. Hearing what you both want more of makes it easier to feel motivated and excited about the future rather than frustrated about what’s not working in the present. When

65% of startup failures

are attributed to problems

within

management team dynamics, Gottman’s relationship research is also worth paying attention to at work.

The GAIN framing not only leads to behavior change, it can also elicit better decisions.

One study

by Amos Tversky and colleagues showed that doctors given data with an

avoid

framing (“The mortality rate is 10%”) made the most effective treatment decision only 50% of the time, whereas those with the same inputs but using an

approach

framing (“The survival rate is 90%”) made the most effective decision 84% of the time. The meaning of the framing is identical (10% rate of mortality is the same as 90% rate of survival), but the

avoid

framing and its threat mindset distort our ability to think and process information clearly. This is precisely the ability we want people to be engaging when receiving feedback and considering a change in behavior.

This dynamic plays out elsewhere in the workplace as well (and in a way I keep thinking about as leaders fret over AI adoption strategies). Amy Edmonson’s

research

compared teams in 16 different organizations implementing the same new technology. She showed that teams whose leaders pitched it using an “aspirational” framing (e.g. “This will help patients recuperate faster”) were far more effective than those using a “defensive” framing (e.g. “The reason for doing this . . . is to avoid being blindsided by competitive pressures in the future”). The successful leaders not only emphasized what to move toward, they also framed getting there as a team effort.

Our brains are engaged in a constant calculus: approach or avoid, friend or foe? When we frame a conversation with the potential benefits of change and acknowledge what we need to change ourselves, it sends a strong approach signal—a powerful “we’re on the same team” message—to the other party. They are then more likely to hear it as “Hey, this information can be really useful to me, and I want to help this person too.”

To explore what all this theory looks like in a real feedback conversation, see the case of one of my clients below.

GAIN in the real world: Giving feedback to a micromanaging founder

Laura is a VP of Business Development at a high-growth startup, where she reports to a founder who practiced micromanagement like it was her religion. Unsurprisingly, this was quite frustrating for Laura. It would have been tempting to approach this challenge by telling the founder how deflating this experience was and asking her to change (or by just avoiding the conversation altogether, growing resentful over time, and eventually looking for another job). Instead, Laura processed her own raw reaction first, using her emotions to uncover what she actually wanted to get out of a feedback conversation: the founder to give her more space. Laura understood Gottman’s “dream within a conflict” principle, so when the founder was complaining to her yet again about other teams—this time the sales team—Laura seized the moment.

When she began the conversation, she named the founder’s

actions

and the

impacts

that mattered

to the founder

, and empathized with her on those points. Then, instead of dwelling on the founder’s pain or going into her own, Laura turned toward the possible

goal

for the founder

, emphasizing the benefits for the founder in a way that aligned with her own goal. (GAIN conversations don’t have to present the goal first to be effective, as long as they are in the spirit of GAIN and the goal is clarified soon after.) Finally, she guided the conversation toward

next actions

that would accomplish

both

of their goals.

Here’s how she masterfully led the conversation, as she reported it to me:

Actions and Impacts:

“Right now, I can see you are on every sales call, email, in all of the Slack channels across every team, and I can only imagine how exhausting that must be.

I imagine that you feel like you have to do it because you feel the job won’t get done unless you do.”

Goal:

“I think there might be another approach here that could create more time for you to focus on the areas where your impact is greatest and, at the same time, help the team step up, do better work, and feel more motivated. It could even reduce some of the stress and burnout you were talking about.”

The founder responded honestly,

“I know, I know, and I want to fix it. But I just don’t see any other way of doing things, and I don’t see the sales team getting the results.”

A feedback opening line is an invitation, and Laura’s was so inviting, the founder accepted and immediately engaged with it. The response, though brief, revealed lots of useful information: the founder’s desire to change, the obstacle to that change, and what matters most to her—getting results. Laura can leverage this to move the dialogue forward toward her desired outcomes.

Next, Laura took her founder’s concern seriously and engaged her further, asking more questions that invite the founder to reflect more deeply on the obstacle she’s raising while emphasizing the importance of trust:

“If that’s the case, do you have the right people? If you can’t trust people to do the work, are they the right people?”

“Yeah,”

the founder said,

“I think that’s the bigger question—the thing I need to think about.”

Having built a sense of “I’m on your team” in the conversation, Laura continued and challenged her:

“The interesting thing is, though, I know you trust

me

a lot—you’ve mentioned it, and I’ve even observed it—but you still sometimes do it with me.”

Here, Laura doesn’t judge or criticize; she just references her observation of the founder’s pattern of actions (participating in all calls, emails, Slack channels), as well as the exceptions to that pattern (“You’ve mentioned [your trust in me], and I’ve even observed it”).

The founder acknowledged,

“I know. It’s just my way; I’m so used to doing it. I get everything done myself. I push, push, push.”

So Laura asked,

“What would be more helpful for you, so you don’t have to do that?”

Instead of solely focusing on what the founder can do differently, Laura’s question broadens the possible levers for change to include herself and others. Some people are wary that this approach might mean less accountability for the feedback recipient, letting them off the hook. Rather, more levers means more leverage to get what we want.

Next actions:

The founder replied,

“I really appreciate when you proactively send me updates—which I know you already do. But also, you can just tell me when I’m doing it.”

Laura confirmed:

“Sounds great. So moving forward, I’ll continue proactively sending you updates, you’ll work on stepping back—i.e. not jumping in or pinging me with status checks—and I’ll name it in the moment if the old pattern rears its head.”

These are clear, concrete actions that they can both take to change the feedback recipient’s pattern of checking in unnecessarily. The founder conveyed her intent to stop while also acknowledging her imperfection and inviting Laura to help her make this change—which was particularly empowering given the power dynamic.

The improvement took time to sink in, though Laura felt full agency to help move it forward. A month later, she shared that the founder had reverted to micromanagement mode three times that week, but then stopped after Laura told her when she would send an update. Over time, the micromanaging pattern ceased almost completely, and not only that; Laura told me that she felt newly confident in her ability to initiate challenging conversations.

Laura navigated a tough dynamic with someone holding greater organizational power and emerged with both the founder’s commitment to change and an invitation to support that change—while building her own confidence and skills.

GAIN feedback principles and phrases

This example models both the practical steps of the GAIN framework and the spirit of it: care

and

challenge, offering empathy

and

expressing what the feedback giver wants—in that order.

Here’s a simple breakdown of Laura’s conversation through the lens of GAIN, though her goal comes in the third sentence, not the first:

You can download the GAIN template

here

, with prompts to guide you.

Let’s dive into the nuances and some helpful phrases and principles you can consider, drawing on Laura’s example and others.

G: The Goal

The essence of the Goal section is naming the topic and pointing to the possible benefits of making a change in such a way that they feel you’re on their team.

These benefits can be for you too, but they

must

be appealing to the feedback recipient. This is not what you want them to

do

differently; it’s the impact created by them doing it. What will they gain from making a change?

If they understand that motivation up front, they’re hooked, and everything else flows from there.

What struck me most in the way Laura shared her feedback is that it didn’t sound like a complaint or criticism at all. Instead, she shared it in a way that genuinely came across as a desirable opportunity for both the founder and her. She mentioned the current pain but oriented to the possible gain, “the dream within the conflict” that Gottman’s research showed to be so effective.

Here are a few ways to approach this.

If you can find even one instance of someone already using the desired behavior, it will help them recognize what that looks and feels like. Further, they will feel more confident in their ability to act in that way. The impact of that behavior serves as the Goal for the feedback.

“Even more” conveys that they both have some foundations to build on and that they’re not there yet.

Sometimes it’s important to emphasize the “not yet,” the gap between where performance is now and where it needs to be. In those cases, we must offer both challenge and support. These qualities are usually understood as opposites (“I’m either extremely honest or extremely caring”), but that is a misconception.

One randomized, double-blind controlled

study

from Stanford tested the impact of integrating these two qualities using the sentence “I’m giving you these comments because I have very high expectations [challenge] and I know that you can reach them [support].” Compared with a placebo—“I’m giving you these comments so that you’ll have feedback on your paper”—the first sentence more than

quadrupled

the number of revisions to the original work that one group of students did, and the revisions themselves were on average 26% better.

Each of the phrases above can engage people’s interest in the conversation, but the key is that it be an actual conversation—a dialogue, not a monologue. One of the most common mistakes I see people make is

delivering

feedback instead of exploring it together.

The point is not you giving the feedback; it’s them getting it—and ideally, you getting some insights too. In this way, communication is like a game of catch: the other person needs to actually receive and hear the feedback in order for the game to be successful. GAIN largely focuses on throwing better so it’s easier for them to catch whatever you’re throwing, but ultimately, effective communication is an alternating rhythm of throwing and catching.

You can initiate this rhythm by pausing routinely and asking a question that elicits their reflections, reactions, and their own feedback for you. This creates two benefits: (1) it can reveal what message they are actually getting, giving you the opportunity to clarify immediately if needed, and (2), equally important, it can expand your understanding of root causes, revealing blind spots you may have (and keeping you from putting your foot in your mouth).

Especially if you’re not clear yet on why they would care or what

their

goal is, listen before you talk.

A & I: Actions & Impacts

It’s not just the goal that determines receptivity or defensiveness. The most common move I see that leads people to put up their shields is hearing critical judgments. They’re an almost guaranteed way to trigger people and derail the conversation.

Feedback is effective when it’s actionable. To make it actionable instead of objectionable, feedback masters share

observations

of people’s actions and their impacts, not judgments. “Response times to client emails averaged 4.2 days last month” lands very differently than “You’re being unprofessional.”

Even if this seems obvious, it becomes challenging when we’re annoyed and feeling justified in our annoyance (“Product just threw this over the wall; they don’t care about our time!”).

Our judgments feed our emotions

, which then amplify our judgments.

And what seems straightforward in theory can be deceptively difficult in the face of real-world situations. In over 50 feedback workshops across dozens of tech companies, I’ve asked people to share real-world feedback examples, and there hasn’t been a single workshop in which everyone agreed on whether every example we talked through was a judgment or observation.

Fortunately, recognizing and translating our judgments is a skill easily developed with practice, one even more easily practiced now with AI. To do so, you can use this

custom GPT

or just input this prompt:

Give me examples to practice identifying whether something is an observation or a judgment. Explain why I’m right or wrong after I answer, then give another example, making them increasingly ambiguous each time.

There’s a strong correlation here: the more clearly we see what is impacting progress, the more quickly we can identify new strategies to move toward our Goal.

Laura never called it “micromanagement” to the founder. She didn’t even use the word “feedback”; she just described the actions and their effects as she observed them.

This gets to the essence of feedback as I define it: creating visibility into people’s actions and their impacts

. Simple cause and effect is a line of sight that the actor often lacks. Often, not only do we lack visibility into how we are impacting others; we lack the ability to step back from and see our own behavior.

Avoid flattering judgments too

Even for well-practiced feedback masters, it can be tempting to deploy critical judgment’s close cousin, flattering judgment. Well-intentioned people might offer praise and compliments, like “You’re a rockstar PM” or “You’re so brilliant. You have such a gift,” to motivate or thank colleagues. But just as critical judgments can trigger defensiveness, flattering ones can destroy growth mindset, autonomy, and productivity, and foster people-pleasing.

The “rockstar PM” worries about maintaining that image if she fails, turning challenges into threats rather than opportunities to learn and grow. Carol Dweck’s

mindset research

explains why:

If the cause of my success is my brilliance, what does that imply about the cause of my potential failures?

This is especially pernicious in contexts that require experimentation, where failure—however temporary—is inevitable. This dynamic is exacerbated when the flattering judgments come from a manager or executive.

That rockstar PM’s focus reorients from iteration and impact to seeking approval.

She could spend a lot of energy trying to get an “Exceeds Expectations” on her next report card—I mean performance review—instead of focusing on influencing user behavior or being more effective in her work relationships.

By contrast, observations of people’s actions and impacts point them to what is within their control—the actions they can change or keep doing and the potential impacts of those actions. They see how to increase their own ability to create their desired outcomes. This means that giving this kind of actionable feedback can actually

evoke

feedback recipients’ growth mindsets, or

as Satya Nadella frames it

, help them shift from know-it-alls to learn-it-alls. If you want greater openness and motivation, share impacts, not judgments!

Here’s how

.

Acknowledge your own actions and their impacts

Judgments aren’t the only trigger for defensiveness. When you as the feedback giver have contributed to a situation but you aren’t noting that, the recipient’s attention can latch onto this gap. “Yeah, but what about

your

actions?” they wonder. You can preempt this reaction by simply and directly acknowledging your contribution.

As a social species, humans unconsciously mirror the behavior we see in others around us. The crowd waits at a light, and so do we; we start jaywalking, and others are more likely to as well. This plays out interpersonally too. Far too often, we approach feedback conversations with the implicit attitude of “You are the one who needs to change.” From this angle, it’s no surprise that what we get back is the other person looking at us thinking, “No,

you

are the one who needs to change.” We tend to get what we give.

But this human instinct is actually good news: if you want to lead a conversation and a relationship in a specific direction, just start moving in that direction yourself. The message switches to “I think we can both shift some things that will make it easier to change and move toward that Goal.”

This is one of most disarming feedback approaches I’ve ever encountered—and one of the least-used. Once we have acknowledged our contribution and shown that we are monitoring our own behavior, the other person can release their focus on our actions, freeing up their attention to concentrate on their own actions.

There’s an added benefit here for the feedback giver: shifts that I make in one relationship often apply to other relationships too. When I was frustrated with one client constantly rescheduling, I realized how I was contributing to and even encouraging the problem by always saying yes to requests. Quick check-ins with all my clients around minimizing changes dropped rescheduling requests to zero across the board. More levers, more leverage.

N: Next actions

What do we do with those levers we identified? Once feedback has been shared and received, the final step in an effective feedback conversation is defining next actions. These could be actions for the feedback recipient, the feedback giver, or both.

The clearer and more concrete our action-and-impact observations are, the more obvious the potential next actions become.

Sometimes it’s a very direct link: “Hey, when you don’t schedule interviews in the time frame you said you would, it slows down our hiring process. Can you schedule those this week and let me know if there are any blockers?”

Other times, arriving at next actions is more complex and uncomfortable. Our insides are screaming, “This conversation is awkward. Get me out of here already!” But even an otherwise-great feedback conversation will often amount to nothing if we don’t close it clearly and concretely.

There are a few ways of doing this that increase buy-in and follow-through.

First, ask for their ideas

In an often-maddening phenomenon, people will resist change that they themselves want if it appears to come at the expense of their autonomy. We may want to change, but we want to choose it.

One simple way of supporting someone’s sense of autonomy is to ask for their ideas of what to change before offering our own. When the other person is really on board with the Goal and open to hearing what we’ve shared, given even a few moments of brainstorming, I have found that they regularly come up with useful options I had not considered. They also tend to be more motivated to pursue ideas they have generated themselves.

For feedback that is difficult to hear regardless of how it’s shared, a feedback conversation might actually be a series of conversations, so it’s often best to sleep on it and schedule a future time to return and commit to next actions (not just “later”).

Co-create through brainstorming together

If you are itching to share your own idea but also want to involve them, this option opens up the opportunity for both. It also lets you build on each other’s ideas.

Make specific requests—and make it easy to say no

Sometimes asking for the other person’s ideas can feel disingenuous when all you want is to propose your own. In that case, share your idea, and offer it as a suggestion or a request in a way that still honors their autonomy—in other words, not as a demand.

To support this feeling, make it easy for them to say no to or edit the request. A

meta-analysis

of 52 studies showed that “Feel free to say no” doubled the percentage of time that people said

yes

to a request. Supporting autonomy conveys real respect, which preempts resistance, engenders goodwill, and helps people think clearly about the suggestion on its own merits. If they actually say no, you will get to learn what’s blocking them and how to incorporate that in the next actions. (And if you’re feeling attached to your idea and actually want to demand it, remember that it’s the Goal you care about, not the way they get there.)

It’s also important to ensure that your specific request includes what you want more of, not just less of. As psychologist Marshall Rosenberg, the author of

Nonviolent Communication

, said, “You can’t do a don’t.” Otherwise, when they find themselves in the same situation again, they’ll be unclear about what alternative behavior to engage in.

Frame it as an experiment

When someone is considering a new behavior, that means there’s an element of uncertainty. Understandably, there can be some hesitance about committing to do something they’ve never done before, no matter how much they follow the logic. Instead of committing to something new “forever,” explicitly acknowledge it as an experiment for a set time period.

WWW:

Who

will do

What

by

When

?

This question moves growth, progress, and whole companies forward faster than any other one I know.

“Let’s” and “should” are insidious impostors when it comes to action items.

Let’s

: Is that you or me?

Should

: Is that an idea we’re considering or a commitment? When you hear these words, use them as an automatic signal to pause and clarify who will do what by when.

Schedule a check-in

If you don’t set a clear check-in, you run the risk of not seeing the change you were hoping for and having to initiate a follow-up feedback conversation if you still want to close the gap. The discomfort of this is higher, so it’s easier to avoid, and the frustration festers into resentment and helplessness. If instead you establish a time and date to check in, you set up three more desirable possibilities:

An agreed-upon check-in time often increases the accountability and expectation of change.

The behavior may have changed, and you have a built-in moment to appreciate the impacts you’re seeing and the progress toward the Goal, encouraging even more development. This reinforces a growth mindset.

If the behavior hasn’t changed or hasn’t had the desired impact, you will recognize this sooner and be able to troubleshoot and course-correct faster.

AI in feedback

That’s a lot to digest and consider when preparing and leading a feedback conversation. Fortunately, you’re not on your own anymore.

While many people fear AI will erode human connection, I see the opposite happening with clients and in

our workshops

1.

Replit

What it is

A leading vibe-coding platform that takes a plain English description of what you want to create and builds a production-ready app. It includes a native database, user authentication, security scan, and hosting. It also supports most programming languages. They launched

Agent 3

, which can run for more than 200 minutes autonomously, building, testing, and fixing your app on the fly.

Why I love it

It’s a powerful full-stack vibe-coding platform that lets you build highly complex web and mobile apps. Unlike other vibe-coding platforms, you can single-shot fairly sophisticated applications. It includes a fully featured (web-based) IDE and automatically tests the apps it builds using its internal browser (i.e. checking buttons, forms, APIs) and then auto-fixes the issues it finds.

What I use it for

The entire (surprisingly sophisticated)

2.

Warp

What it is

An agentic development environment that’s essentially a drop-in replacement for your Mac/Windows/Linux terminal. It was originally built for engineers but is increasingly used by PMs, designers, data scientists, and even recruiting teams.

Why I love it

It’s truly a magical experience, and unlike anything else I’ve used. It makes you feel like a superhero. Anytime I run into a problem working in my Mac terminal, AI solves it for me. How did we ever work with computers without something like this?

What I use it for

I’ve used it to download YouTube videos to convert them to MP3s (for my son’s

Yoto

), analyze all of my locally-saved podcast transcripts to find the most-mentioned books, and install gnarly packages with a bunch of weird dependencies. I just tell it what I want to do, and it figures it out. Here’s me asking Warp to download the Linear YouTube video below:

Linear

What it is

A beautifully designed tool for tracking your team’s tasks, organizing projects, and building your roadmap. It even has deep agent integrations, so you can delegate your tickets to an agent to take a first pass at a task. The future is now.

Why I love it

In my mind, there’s no question that every startup and modern product team should be using Linear. And at this point, most are.

What I use it for

OK, so I don’t actually use Linear, because it’s just me. But if I had a team, I wouldn’t even consider another tool.

Wispr Flow

What it is

Magical voice-dictation that actually works the way you’ve always expected this to work. Press the function key on your laptop, talk, and it instantly (and accurately) transcribes everything you’ve said. Works across Mac, iPhone, and Windows, and with every vibe-coding tool and IDE.

Why I love it

It’s so fast, and it’s wildly accurate. It understands the context of the conversation,  filters out filler words, and learns your unique acronyms, terms, and phrases. If you’ve tried the native mic transcription on your phone, this is a whole different ballgame.

What I use it for

I’ve always preferred typing over talking, so I’ve never gotten into transcription apps, but Wispr Flow changed how I work. Since it’s so good, I’ve found myself using it constantly, especially on my

phone

. For example, my wife is a big texter, and instead of having to type out long messages all day, I press a button, say it, and send it.

Gamma

What it is

An AI-powered document creation tool that generates polished presentations, landing pages, and documents from a simple prompt. Describe what you want, upload the raw data, and get back a compelling deck/doc/website. And just last week,

they launched Gamma 3.0

, which adds a bunch of really cool new powers.

Why I love it

If Cursor is making engineers faster, Gamma is doing the same for PMs. Creating decks and docs is one of the most time-consuming and annoying parts of most builders’ jobs. I also just love

the story of Gamma

—small team, little funding, profitable, and AI-native from day one.

What I use it for

Most recently, I’ve been experimenting with using Gamma to create shareable summaries of my podcast episodes. Here’s

Ethan Smith’s episode on AEO

,

Ben Horowitz’s episode on leadership

,

Brendan Foody’s story of Mercor

, and

a peek at an upcoming episode on evals

. I copied and pasted the transcripts, clicked a few buttons, and . . . magic.

Magic Patterns

What it is

Magic Patterns is an AI prototyping tool built specifically for PMs and designers. It’s not trying to get you to build production-ready apps or launch startups. It’s designed instead to be the best tool in the world at prototyping your ideas using your existing products’ styles, getting feedback from customers, and then helping you build a real product in your regular development environment.

Why I love it

I’ve been playing with all of the popular prototyping tools, and I find that Magic Patterns most often produces the highest-quality, most useful, and most correct results. It’s especially great at quick iterations and ideation because it only produces frontend code, so you don’t have to worry about random database/infra architecture limitations. I encourage you to do your own side-by-side comparison to see for yourself. I also love that it’s not trying to be everything to everyone—it’s designed specifically to solve pain points for product teams at large companies, with features like

Descript

What it is

An AI-powered editor that gives everyone (including product managers!) the power to create and edit professional videos. Use it to make launch videos, design walk-throughs, for LinkedIn posts, etc. You edit videos like you edit Google Docs (wild!), and it now includes an agentic video editor, called Underlord, that makes it even easier to make tricky changes (

see example

).

Why I love it

I have zero video editing skills and I’m constantly making and editing video and audio. I wouldn’t be able to do this without Descript. It’s been my tool of choice for over five years now, and I’ve never thought about using anything else.

What I use it for

I use Descript basically every day. I use it to record my podcast ads and intros to each episode, and my production team uses it exclusively to take my raw podcast recordings and turn them into the videos you see on

YouTube

1. Most popular articles

Over the course of the year, the articles below are the ones which were read by the most subscribers.

How Claude Code is built.

Claude Code took the industry by storm in 2025, and we sat down with two of its founding engineers. They revealed how they helped make command line interfaces (CLIs) surprisingly relevant in such a short space of time.

State of the software engineering job market in 2025

. It’s been a bizarre 12 months in the job market, when job seekers struggled to hear back about their applications, and employers found it hard to hire solid engineers. We delved into the state of things in a three-part series on data (

part 1

), what hiring managers saw (

part 2

), and job seekers’ personal stories (

part 3

).

Real-world engineering challenges: building Cursor

.

Founded in 2023, Cursor became one of the most – if not

the

most popular – dev tools this year. A deepdive into its tech stack, engineering decisions, and the database migrations which took place behind the scenes.

MCP Protocol: a new AI dev-tooling building block.

The Model Context Protocol that extends AI capabilities for both IDEs and AI agents. An in-depth look at the technology with its co-creator, David Soria Parra.

AI fakers exposed in dev recruitment: postmortem

.

In March, a full-remote startup nearly hired a backend engineer who didn’t exist, after they used an AI filter and a fake resume to try and hoodwink recruiters. It’s also possible the scammer was a North Korean agent. Indeed, just a few days ago, Amazon

caught

one posing as a US contractor. Incidents like these have probably helped contribute to a decline in the number of remote jobs, and made it harder to get hired.

My personal favorites:

AI Engineering in the real world

. What does AI engineering look like in practice? Hands-on examples and learnings from software engineers turned “AI engineers” at seven companies – with inspiration for how it’s relatively easy for a software engineer to become an “AI engineer.”

Inside Google’s Engineering Culture

.

A broad, deep dive into how Google works from the perspective of SWEs and eng managers.

What are Forward Deployed Engineers, and why are they so in demand?

Startups and scaleups went on a hiring spree for a software engineering role pioneered by Palantir. A deepdive into the role, and why FDEs became so popular this year.

Cross-platform mobile development.

Cross-platform mobile development was on the rise in 2025. An in-depth look into the most popular frameworks: React Native, Flutter, native-first, and web-based technologies, and how to pick the right approach

The 10x “overemployed” engineer

.

One improbable story this year was that of a clearly talented software engineer who tricked more than a dozen Silicon Valley startups. He aced the interviews and got hired – then proceeded to do almost zero work, all the while collecting paychecks and seeking out more job interviews. The music stopped for this blagger when one frustrated founder who’d hired and fired him went public.

2. The podcast

I launched

The Pragmatic Engineer podcast

18 months ago because I was having interesting conversations with tech folks during research for the written articles, and it felt like a bit of a waste to not share these talks with readers in more detail. Overall, I’ve been very happy with the decision to experiment with the podcast format.

This has been the pod’s first full year, and the feedback has been positive. When I meet people at conferences and events, around a third say they discovered The Pragmatic Engineer via the podcast. At the end of this year, the podcast has crossed 10M downloads across YouTube, Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and other apps. In 2026, I’ll prioritize quality over quantity even more, so expect two or three episodes per month on Wednesdays.

Here are some highlights from the podcast in 2025, which are good places to start if you’re diving into the show for the first time:

How Linux is built with Greg Kroah-Hartman

: the longtime Linux kernel maintainer breaks down the inner workings of Linux development; from its unique trust model, to the benefits of open-source contribution. This is the episode that was most popular with listeners this year, judging by the feedback.

Netflix’s Engineering Culture

.

A very rare peek into how engineering works at the streaming giant, with CTO Elizabeth Stone.

The Philosophy of Software Design – with John Ousterhout

: why thoughtful software design matters more than ever, as AI transforms coding practices and developer workflows.

From Software Engineer to AI Engineer – with Janvi Kalra

.

Janvi impressed tech leaders after teaching herself AI engineering. She discusses the tactics and focus that helped her get into OpenAI.

How Swift and Mojo were created with Chris Lattner

. A conversation about how better language and compiler design can open the door to faster, more accessible AI development, with one of the most productive software engineers around.

How AI will change software engineering – with Martin Fowler

.

Thoughtworks’s Chief Architect and author of the bestselling books Refactoring and Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, provides a level-headed take on what AI really means for the tech biz.

Measuring the impact of AI on software engineering – with Laura Tacho

. Findings from 180+ companies on how AI really affects devs’ productivity – and what many teams get wrong.

Code Complete with Steve McConnell.

3. Tech industry in 2025

The main theme of 2025 has, of course, been AI, and how it’s changing software engineering – but we also covered numerous other matters and emerging trends.

The AI coding tools explosion.

Claude Code

rapidly became a favorite of devs,

Cursor

grew to be the most popular AI coding tool, the term “

vibe coding

” went mainstream (and was even

pronounced

‘Word of the Year’ by Collins Dictionary – despite being two words), the

MCP protocol

won wide adoption, and coding with agents slowly overtook using AI for “just” autocomplete.

Weird job market stays tight.

As we covered in the

state of the software engineering job market in 2025

series, 2025 saw many professionals experience more struggle than usual to land the next job – except AI engineers and senior+ engineers with eye-catching resumes.

RTO acceleration.

Amazon

mandated

a 5-day return to office in January 2025, and Instagram

will do so

from February 2026. Meanwhile, the share of full-remote jobs

kept falling

.

Decline of StackOverflow.

This started before ChatGPT launched, but LLMs seem to have accelerated

the decline

. New generations of developers may have no idea what StackOverflow is, nor what made it so important in the 2010s.

AI-fueled cheating crisis.

Remote algorithmic interviews provide little signal these days, now that invisible tools help candidates ace them without much preparation. In response, some companies allow AI tools in interviews and set more ambitious problems, while others restore in-person interviews. More on this in

Ban or embrace AI in tech interviews?

and

How AI is changing tech interviews.

OpenAI’s aggressive expansion.

The leading AI lab didn’t slow down in 2025, and is

valued

at a jaw-dropping $500B. It

became

a for-profit,

launched a browser

to compete with Chrome,

bought

experimentation platform Statsig for $1B,

probably spent

more than $170M this year on Datadog, and

is making

plans to go public.

AI surprises.

Senior engineers use AI coding tools

more efficiently than juniors

, but equally, juniors are

more “profitable” than before

due to faster onboarding. AI seems to amplify coding knowledge for seniors, and could help juniors become seniors faster. Even though engineers at AI startups can usually use AI tools without any kind of budget limits – it is also AI startups which set

extreme working hours cultures

in their bid to outrun competition.

4. The Software Engineer’s Guidebook

It’s been two years since I

published

The Software Engineer’s Guidebook for navigating senior, tech lead, staff, and principal positions at established tech companies and startups. In November, I

shared a recap

to mark two years since publication, including learnings from taking the self-publishing route.

The book has now sold more than 40,000 copies, proving it was worth spending a very lengthy four years on writing it! This year, it was translated into four more languages, and is

available

in Japanese, Simplified and Traditional Chinese editions, Mongolian, German, and Korean.

In Mongolia, a 30-person startup did the

translation

, and this summer I flew over to visit them. It was there that I learned that the company which hosted me – Nasha Tech – also builds the Uber Eats of Mongolia.

A delightful moment was learning that the Japanese edition was a bestseller of the week at Tokyo’s largest bookstore:

Best-seller in Kinokuniya Shinjuku, in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo

As a fun fact, the Japanese edition is printed in a special way: it reads vertically (top to bottom), and right to left. The publisher – O’Reilly Japan – told me it’s an unusual but purposeful choice for a technical book:

“Generally, novels and typical non-fiction books use vertical writing, which requires right binding (right-to-left reading). Technical books, due to code snippets, are usually written horizontally with left binding.

However, for The Software Engineer’s Guidebook, we intentionally chose vertical writing with right-side binding so that readers can take their time with the content. It’s quite an unusual choice for an O’Reilly Japan book”.

In November, a hardcover edition was published, which I decided to do after a reader asked to have their paperback signed, and I saw it was in poor condition due to heavy usage, with lots of notes and highlights. Softcovers don’t withstand lots of heavy use, and seeing that beaten-up copy was the final prompt to create the hardcover.

Happy Holidays!

With that, the newsletter and podcast head off for a winter break. I wish you and your loved ones a very happy holiday, with time to rest. If you end up being oncall during this period, fingers crossed for a completely uneventful one. If your company has

code freezes

in place for this period, this could help with that.

Today, we cover:

Internal dev tooling at Meta & “trajectories.”

An overview of three different internal AI-coding tools which devs at Meta use. Also, the company has started sharing the prompts which devs make when generating code – and it’s pretty controversial.

GitHub upsets devs by charging for self-hosted CI/CD.

GitHub Actions is notoriously slow and unreliable. But instead of improving the service, GitHub sought to charge by the minute for using third-party CI/CD solutions. That didn’t go down well with devs.

Industry Pulse.

Warsaw on track to become the “tech capital of the EU,” hiring juniors could actually be “profitable” thanks to AI tools, GitHub is working on stacked diffs, non-devs use LLMs for more coding tasks, Cursor migrates CMS to Markdown, OpenAI gets rid of 6-month vesting cliff, and more.

“Apple Tax” alive in Japan.

A US court rejected Apple’s appeal, and the iPhone maker can no longer ban alternative in-app payments or impose junk fees on third-party payments… in the US. Meanwhile in Japan, Apple is pulling the same trick that got it in trouble in the US.

1. Internal dev tooling at Meta & “trajectories”

An interesting detail about Meta that I learnt from chatting with two current software engineers there: last week, the social media giant rolled out a feature allowing devs to see the AI prompt history on diffs (internal lingo for pull requests) in review. And this new feature launch is causing some controversy in the workplace!",https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com

In this episode

How have servers and the cloud evolved in the last 30 years, and what might be next? Bryan Cantrill was a distinguished engineer at Sun Microsystems during both the Dotcom Boom and the Dotcom Bust. Today, he is the co-founder and CTO of Oxide Computer, where he works on modern server infrastructure.

In this episode of

The Pragmatic Engineer

, Bryan joins me to break down how modern computing infrastructure evolved. We discuss why the Dotcom Bust produced deeper innovation than the Boom, how constraints shape better systems, and what the rise of the cloud changed and did not change about building reliable infrastructure.

Our conversation covers early web infrastructure at Sun, the emergence of AWS, Kubernetes and cloud neutrality, and the tradeoffs between renting cloud space and building your own. We also touch on the complexity of server-side software updates, experimenting with AI, the limits of large language models, and how engineering organizations scale without losing their values.

If you want a systems-level perspective on computing that connects past cycles to today’s engineering decisions, this episode offers a rare long-range view.

Interesting sections from the episode

How the “Dotcom Bust” brought more tech creativity than the “Boom.”

As Bryan recalled (

starting at 14:53

), memories from the Dotcom Boom and Bust:

“A boom can get you to care about things that you actually don’t care about. This is because in a boom, everyone is so financially driven that it’s hard not to become financially driven!

But [the financial side] is actually not why I got into this. So during the bust, I was definitely able to put a meal on my table and a roof over my head.  But [the Bust] was a reminder about what’s important.

We did better technical work in the Bust than in the Boom.

I think that’s because in the Bust it was like: okay, now we

really

have to focus. We have fewer resources. These fewer resources actually force more creativity!

So all of the things that we did, certainly speaking at Sun and system software, so

ZFS

filesystem] and

DTrace

[dynamic tracing framework] and

Service Manager Facility

[unified service management framework in Solaris 10], all these things that were really revolutionary for the operating system. All of these [innovations] happened in this same kind of post-Bust period of time, from 2001 to 2005.”

How Jeff Bezos tricked everyone with AWS pricing.

Bryan was running a small competitor to AWS called Joyent, and so he knew something about AWS pricing that the rest of the world was yet to catch up to (

starting at 26:07

)

“Jeff Bezos is the apex predator of camitalism.

The thing that was so impressive is they were able to give people the idea that this [AWS] was a terrible business.

In particular, they did not break out their financials. So everyone’s like: 'oh my God, what an awful business! They’re [AWS is] cutting the price every year. This is a classic ‘red ocean’. It’s bloody, you don’t want to compete.

At Joyent, we were actually competing head to head with AWS. We had a public cloud. And unlike AWS, we took the software that we had used to run the public cloud and made it available for people that wanted to run a cloud on-prem on their own hardware. So people that would buy Dell or HP or Super Micro, they would buy [Joyent’s] software and they would run it and get a cloud.

So we ran a public cloud and we knew what the economics of a public cloud were, namely

pretty

good. Margins

were

good! And so what we knew that Amazon wasn’t volunteering [the price cuts.]

We knew is that AWS S3 was underwriting a war on big box retail, and that S3 was paying for your Prime shipping!

So it was a genius move [by Bezos.]”

Why Kubernetes might have become really popular, in part thanks to AWS.

Bryan,

starting at 27:42

:

“There was a period of time when it felt like in order to be in the cloud [business] you have to implement every AWS API [as a cloud provider]. So there’s this idea that you had to be [fully] compatible with EC2. One reason it was thought that GCP and Azure could never compete with AWS was because they could never be API compatible.

Then, what starts in 2015 is Kubernetes. Part of that initial attraction to Kubernetes is that people wanted to get some optionality around their cloud — and they felt locked into AWS. They’re like ‘I’m not using all this stuff [on AWS]. I’m not using

Elastic Beanstalk

[PaaS for web applications]. I’m not using

IoT Greenglass

[edge runtime and cloud for IoT services]. I’m not using

Redshift

[SQL-based cloud data warehouse]. What I actually want is this kind of basic infrastructure.

Kubernetes now gives me this layer upon which I can deploy and get some sort of

true

cloud neutrality.

The early momentum behind Kubernetes [felt like] this around this idea of I need to have some optionality [from AWS].”

Interesting: Oxide found it hard to hire hardware engineers who are principles-first

, and folks who can build hardware without a “reference design” available.

Turns out, building a new type of computer like Oxide means creating hardware from scratch, instead of using “reference designs.” Many hardware engineers are simply not used to doing this:

Bryan: “In computer [hardware] design in particular, the high-speed designs are so hard that [electrical engineers] got very accustomed to taking the reference designs. And it was harder to find folks who were willing to take a clean sheet of paper. Ultimately, we found them, and we’ve got an EE (electrical engineering) team that is extraordinary and absolutely fearless.

[The EE engineers at Oxide] didn’t spend their careers at Dell and HPE. They’re coming from [the likes of] GE Medical where they worked on CT systems.

Gergely: “It feels like such a different field. I would naively assume that if you’re building a computer, you’ll try to get electronics engineers who have built computers.

Bryan: “You would think! That was our [initial] thought as well. Then we discovered that we were not getting along with those engineers very well.

We were just finding there’s a lot of friction because there wasn’t a real first-principles approach.

When you get to talk to folks that have been at Dell for a generation, for any design, they’re used to calling what’s called the FAE. FAE stands for the Field Applications Engineer for the voltage regulator. It’s like: ‘well the FAE gives me the design.’ So we ask: ‘Alright, well how do you know that it’s the

right

design?’ So we went,  alright, so let’s go hire that person [who understands the actual design.]”

Bryan initially struggled to find the “right” electrical engineers — until Bryan

shared in an article

that they paid everyone at Oxide a $175,000 base salary in 2021 (today, this number

is $235,000 today

.) This article got shared inside hardware engineering circles, and suddenly they got standout electrical engineers applying — who often have not built computers before, but have been designing electrical equipmen and hardware from zero in other fields.

A member of AWS’s Incident Response team lifts the lid, after playing a key role in resolving the leading cloud provider’s most recent major outage",2026-01-04T04:06:41.743427,Gergely Orosz,"In October, the largest Amazon Web Services (AWS) region in the world suffered an outage lasting 15 hours, which created a global impact as thousands of sites and apps crashed or degraded – including Amazon.com, Signal, Snapchat, and

others

.

AWS released an incident summary three days later, revealing the outage in us-east-1 was

started by

a failure inside DynamoDB’s DNS system, which then spread to Amazon EC2 and to AWS’s Network Load Balancer. The incident summary overlooked questions such as why it took so long to resolve, and some media coverage sought to fill the gap.

The Register

claimed

that an “Amazon brain drain finally sent AWS down the spout”, because some AWS staff who knew the systems inside out had quit the company, and their institutional knowledge was sorely missed.

For more clarity and detail, I went to an internal source at Amazon: Senior Principal Engineer,

Gavin McCullagh

, who was part of the crew which resolved this outage from start to finish. In this article, Gavin shares his insider perspective and some new details about what happened, and we find out how incident response works at the company.

This article is based on Gavin’s account of the incident to me. We cover:

Incident Response team at AWS.

An overview of how global incident response works at the leading cloud provider, and a summary of Gavin’s varied background at AWS.

Mitigating the outage (part 1).

Rapid triage, two simultaneous problems, and extra details on how the DynamoDB outage was eventually resolved.

What caused the outage?

An unlucky, unexpected lock contention across the three DNS enactors started it all. Also, a clever usage of Route 53 as an optimistic locking mechanism.

Oncall tooling & outage coordination.

Amazon’s outage severity scale, tooling used for paging and incident management, and why 3+ parallel calls are often run during a single outage.

Mitigating the outage (part 2).

After the DynamoDB outage was mitigated, the EC2 and Network Load Balancer (NLB) had issues that took hours to resolve.

Post-incident.

The typical ops review process at AWS, and how improvements after a previous major outage in 2023 helped to contain this one.

Improvements and learnings.

Changes that AWS is making to its services, and how the team continues to learn how to handle metastable failures better. Also, there’s a plan to use formal methods for verification, even for systems like DynamoDB’s DNS services.

Spoiler alert: this outage was

not

caused by a brain drain. In fact, many engineers who originally built the service, DNS Enactor (responsible for updating routes in Amazon’s DNS service) ~3 years ago, are very much still at AWS, and five of them hopped onto the outage call in the dead of night, which likely helped to resolve the outage more quickly.

As it turns out – and as readers of this newsletter likely already know! – operating distributed systems is simply hard, and it’s even harder when several things go wrong at once.

1. Incident Response team at AWS

Amazon is made up of many different businesses of which the best known are:

Amazon

Retail

: operates the shopping websites

Amazon.com

, and 21 regional versions including

Amazon.co.uk

,

Amazon.de

, and others.

AWS

: everything to do with Amazon Web Services. Retail is a major customer of AWS.

These organizations operate pretty much independently with their own processes and set ups. Processes are similar but not identical, and both groups evolve how they work over time, separately. In this deepdive, our sole focus is AWS, but it could be assumed Retail has some similar functions, like separate Incident Response teams.

Regions and AZs

: AWS is made up of 38 cloud regions. Each one consists of at least 3 Availability Zones (AZs), which are at least one independent data center, connected via a low-latency network.

Note:

“

Region” and “AZ” mean slightly different things among cloud providers, as covered in

Three cloud providers, three outages, three different responses.

AWS is built up of regions, and each region has at least 3 AZs. More in

this deepdive

Incident Response

is a dedicated team at AWS, staffed by experienced support and infrastructure engineers, who do the following:

Monitor

all 38 AWS regions, continuously. Health KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are set up, so it’s easy to tell if a service is healthy or not. These KPIs vary by service, but typical ones include monitoring API success rates and response latencies, as well as synthetic canaries.

Get alerted

when a region becomes unhealthy, or KPIs suggest it might be.

Coordinate

incident calls when an outage happens within a region or AZ.

Oncall rotation 24/7

: someone is always available to respond to an alert.

Interesting detail: the oncall team for Incident Response is distributed across Seattle, Dublin, and Sydney, which is a “follow the sun” rotation, meaning nobody is oncall when it’s nighttime where they are.

Locations of oncall teams in AWS’s Incident Response team

Oncall team members are a mix of senior+ engineers and relatively junior engineers onboarded after training in how to handle alerts and run calls. For significant events like this latest outage, an oncall “AWS Call Leader” is paged automatically. These are more tenured folks, usually principal up to distinguished engineers.

All AWS Service teams and products run their own independent oncall teams.

The AWS Incident Response group is a “safety net” which coordinates large-scale events.

AWS has a “you build it, you run it” mentality: teams have autonomy to decide which service they build, the technologies used, and how they structure it. In return, they are accountable for the service meeting the uptime target; for production services, this means having an active oncall.

We cover more about oncall practices in

Healthy oncall practices,

and detailed compensation philosophies in the

Oncall compensation

article.

Gavin’s background at AWS

For this article, Gavin McCullagh shared the story of how the incident unfolded from his point of view. Gavin joined Amazon’s Dublin office in 2011 and worked for many years as a DNS and Load Balancing Specialist, including working on Route 53 Public DNS, and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) DNS Resolver. Nowadays, Gavin works in a team focused on Incident Response and Resilience for AWS services and customer applications. This includes the AWS Incident Response team, and services like Application Recovery Controller and Fault Injection Service.

Since his early days there, Gavin has been a regular in large-scale incident calls as his first team – Load Balancing – was regularly paged into major incidents because it is central to AWS, and telemetry from load balancers can greatly help with debugging.

2. Mitigating the outage (part 1)

All times below are in Pacific time.

19 Oct, 11:48 PM:

the incident begins and regional health indicators degrade, triggering an alert. Minutes later, AWS Incident Response oncall is paged. The AWS call leader also joins the call. Gavin joins despite not actually being oncall because he figures he might be able to help – which turned out to be a good hunch.

Rapid triage

Triage starts immediately. At this point, 100+ services were showing problems within us-east-1 due to the broad nature of the outage. From experience, the Incident Response Team has learned that it pays to start systematically debugging common layers of the stack. For such a broad outage, it’s usually a core building block with an issue.

Below is a rough checklist of what the team works through:

Systematic investigations begin at the bottom of the stack

The Incident Response team begins by going through a checklist in roughly this order:

Investigate whether there are power failures or significant network failures

Check if the software-defined network and load balancing layers are healthy

Look for issues within DNS and authentication/ authorization services

Confirm that core services are healthy which most AWS products build on; like KMS, DynamoDB and S3

Two problems at once

As the team went through the list, two coincidental issues were uncovered within a minute of each other.

Sunday, 19 Oct, 11:48 PM: a networking failure event starts.

Network packet loss is detected in the “border” network which connects the us-east-1-az1 availability zone to the wider AWS backbone and internet. A Network Border Group is a unique group from which AWS advertises public IP addresses.

11:48 PM: DynamoDB degradation starts.

As packet loss is being detected, DynamoDB also starts to degrade.

11:52 PM:

AWS Incident Response automatically detects an impact upon services in us-east-1, and pages the incident response oncall network engineers, and affected service oncalls.

11:54 PM: Automated Triage suggests Networking.

Incident response’s automated metric triage system completes, noting a) a change in network performance (increase in packet loss) correlated with the time of the event start, and b) that DynamoDB’s metrics have changed at the same time.

Typically

, this would suggest a network issue is the cause of the DynamoDB issue.

Monday, 20 Oct, 00:08 AM: after failover to a secondary conference system (more later), there’s an investigation into the networking event.

As the network event is “lower in the stack” and initially appears to explain the impact on other services (including DynamoDB), the team focuses on fixing the networking issue.

00:26 AM: Red herring.

While the Incident Response team is busy resolving the networking failure in the AZ, someone posts in the incident Slack channel:

“Hang on, why is DynamoDB not resolving in DNS, packet loss would not cause that?”

This is when the Incident Response team realizes that while the networking event has

some

impact, something

bigger

is also happening that’s not caused by the outage. Whatever it is, it’s impacting DynamoDB.

This smaller network outage is lower in the stack and started a few seconds before the first DynamoDB alerts, which led the experienced team off track into mitigating the smaller outage.

20 Oct, 00:27am: the call is divided.

The DynamoDB investigation is split into its own call, so two technical calls run in parallel:

DynamoDB outage: the focus of the dedicated call

Networking outage: resolving the “smaller” outage continues

Resolving the DynamoDB outage

To bring more senior leaders into the call, Gavin messages three longtime DynamoDB frontend engineers, and asks Incident Response to page them, too.

00:31am: realization that it’s a DNS issue.

Using the ubiquitous “dig” tool,

the team sees that something is wrong with DynamoDB’s DNS records.

00:35-00:50am: engineers who designed and authored the DNS Enactor service join.

The root cause of the issue with DynamoDB ended up being identified as a race condition within a DNS Enactor service, as

previously covered

.

A race condition in DNS Enactor services ended up causing the outage

The quorum (collective) of seven DynamoDB engineers includes folks who built and authored a good part of the DNS Enactor and related services, and who have a combined Amazon tenure of over 50 years. With domain experts on the call, the incident responders let them figure out what has gone wrong with DNS Enactors, while looking for ways to mitigate faster.

As the team will later learn, the cause of the event is an edge case bug in how the three Enactors interact, as covered below.

Hitting the “automation paradox.”

The DynamoDB team has built a system with DNS Enactors that automatically does a lot of complicated work to keep their DNS updated. But now that it’s gone wrong, it’s time to manually fix the DNS records.

Here’s where the automation paradox kicked in: the team had never had to manually overwrite the DNS zone files before, as they had a system that could reliably do this! So, it took some time to package up and deploy the change to DNS records via manual intervention.

01:03 AM: a parallel mitigation, before the “full fix.”

The problem is that the DNS records for DynamoDB are empty due to the race condition. The first order of business is to restore

something that works and relieves customers

– even before understanding exactly how things went wrong.

The incident response team prepares a “quick” partial mitigation: within the internal private network, call us-east-1 “

Prod

” (yes, this really is the name!) and apply an Response Policy Zone (RPZ) override on the DNS resolvers to force the DynamoDB IPs into place, for only this internal network. As it hosts many AWS services, this will help restore services like Identity and Access Management (

IAM

) and Secure Token Service (

STS

).

01:15 AM: mitigation.

The incident team performs an override to force DynamoDB IPs into the us-east-1 Prod DNS on DynamoDB’s most common domain name. Then, the incident team performs a second override of DynamoDB IPs on DynamoDB’s other domain names. At this point, services like IAM, STS, and SQS in us-east-1 recover.

02:15 AM: fix for public DynamoDB DNS found and applied.

The team figures out how to fix the public DNS records for DynamoDB, and applies this to restore DynamoDB for all customers.

The engineers look through the zone and realize the top-level alias record for the DynamoDB domain is pointing at a non-existent tree of records (the old “plan” was deleted). They also note that a set of backup trees which the system maintains are still present. As a result, their task is to stop the automation system to prevent it from interfering, delete the broken alias record, and create a replacement that points at the rollback tree.

02:25 AM: DynamoDB recovered.

The first part of the incident is resolved. However, Amazon EC2 continues to have issues, and Network Load Balancer (NLB) would have problems later that night.

3. What actually caused the outage?

AWS runs three independent DNS Enactors, and each takes DNS plans and updates Route 53. DNS Enactors are

eventually consistent:

meaning that the DNS plans in any single Enactor will eventually be consistent with the source of truth. This is unlike strongly consistent systems where you can be certain that after writing something, the whole system is consistent.

Using an

optimistic locking

mechanism

is

a common solution to prevent multiple writers from changing the same record. The AWS team wanted to achieve this: have only one Enactor writing to Route 53 at any single given time.

You need to have some kind of key-value database to implement optimistic locking. For example, you could use DynamoDB for this:

DynamoDB could be an optimistic locking mechanism – but it’s not what the AWS team decided to do

The problem with this approach would have been that DynamoDB itself depends on DNS Enactors, so this would create a circular dependency:

Introducing circular dependencies is risky, and the AWS team chose not to do so

Instead, the AWS team solved the locking problem in a clever way by using Route 53 as the database for optimistic locking.

As Senior Principal Engineer Craig Howard

explains

:

“We didn’t want to add any other dependencies [to DNS Enactors]. Right now, all we depend on is the DNS Plan, and Route 53 (Amazon’s DNS service.) Can we use Route 53 to create a lock? Well, you can!

You create a TXT record, and the existence of that TXT record indicates who the holder of the lock is. The value of the text record is the host name of the lock holder, and then you put the

epoch

[length of time] in seconds for how long this lock is alive for.”

The AWS team used the transactional characteristic of Route 53: the Route 53 control plane ensures that “CREATE” and “DELETE” operations for TXT are transactional – they either succeed or fail.

So, this is how a lock is created:

CREATE “lock.example.com” TXT “<hostname> <epoch>”

As lock creation is transactional, whenever a DNS Enactor wants to create a

new

lock for its own use, it first deletes the old lock because it can be certain that lock creation /deletion is transactional. Then it creates the new lock:

DELETE “lock.example.com” TXT “<hostname> <old epoch>”

CREATE “lock.example.com” TXT “<hostname> <new epoch>”

// Insert updated Route 53 DNS records

Lock contention is what started the outage.

In this case, one Enactor was very unlucky and failed to gain a lock several times in succession. At that point, the plan it is trying to install is older than anyone had ever envisioned. By the time this “unlucky” Enactor gains the lock, an up-to-date Enactor takes over and its “record clean-up” workflow detects a

very

old plan and deletes it. This was an older plan than the team expected.

Unexpected lock contention: one unlucky Enactor failed to get the lock for ages. When it did, its DNS plan was further behind than expected. Source:

Craig Howard / AWS

Craig explains how this strange race condition played out

in this re:Invent talk

, shared earlier this week.

What started the outage?

As the team will later learn, the cause of the event is an edge case bug in how the three Enactors interact. They are designed to operate independently for resilience, with each Enactor optimistically taking a lock on the DNS zone, making their changes, and releasing the lock. If an Enactor fails to obtain a lock, it backs off and then tries again later.

Begin researching developer productivity, and you’re likely to soon encounter the work of Nicole Forsgren, as lead author of the best-selling book

Accelerate

, and creator of the widely-adopted

DORA

and

SPACE

developer productivity frameworks. And, beyond SPACE is the

DevEx framework

for productivity measurement, created by Abi Noda in collaboration with Nicole.

When I heard that the pair’s work together has continued in a new book about developer experience, I wanted to know more, and had the chance to sit down for a conversation about this big project of theirs.

Frictionless

was released two weeks ago, and Nicole and Noda have been nice enough to share an excerpt from their new title with readers of the Pragmatic Engineer, below.

My copy of

Frictionless

The back cover of

Frictionless

reads:

“

AI can generate code in minutes — so why does shipping software still take forever?

The answer is friction: the invisible barriers that turn quick wins into endless delays. While your competitors ship daily updates, your developers burn out fighting broken tools instead of solving real problems”.

Personally, the lack of impact by AI coding tools to date upon the speed of development and quality of software, is amusing to me. If I take the apps I use, websites I visit, and services I access via software, I don’t see signs of faster iteration, higher quality, and fewer bugs since AI started shaking up the tech industry. An exception might

be AI labs that release new features at eye-catching speed, often faster than much nimbler startups, but it could be argued those begin as experimental features.

What I like about

Frictionless

is that it gives a step-by-step approach for

developers

to smooth their own workflows and be more productive. If it helps teams and companies to move faster and produce more and better software – this is a win for everyone!

This article begins with our conversation, followed by two excerpts from the new book. We cover:

How

Frictionless

relates to Accelerate, DORA, and SPACE.

An obvious question, but I had to ask.

Writing process.

Frictionless took more than 3 years to write – including a “full rewrite”

Making the business case to reduce developer friction.

My usual disclaimer: As with all my recommendations, I was not paid to recommend this book, and none of the links are affiliates. See

for more details.

1. How

Frictionless

relates to Accelerate, DORA, and SPACE

When developer productivity is discussed, your book

Accelerate

often gets a mention. How does Frictionless relate to it – and what makes it different?

Nicole:

“Great question! The two are complementary but different in their foundations.

Accelerate

distills years of research connecting software delivery performance to business outcomes—it tells you what matters and why, but leaves the how to the reader.

Frictionless

is built from years of hands-on work advising teams on DevEx improvements, and it’s designed to help you actually do the work.

Where

Accelerate

is research-backed insights,

Frictionless

is a practitioner’s guide. It gives you a seven-step process you can start wherever you are, plus organizational change frameworks, metrics guidance, and 100+ pages of workbooks. Many of the practices are informed by research, but the book is ultimately about what we’ve seen work in the real world when teams try to improve developer experience.

So, if

Accelerate

is the ‘why,’

Frictionless

is the ‘how’”.

DORA, SPACE and this book

To what extent does the new book build upon the DORA and SPACE frameworks?

Nicole:

“They’re all deeply connected, Frictionless is really the natural evolution of this work.

DORA and

Accelerate

was about improving software delivery through technical, cultural, and process changes. Yes, we focused on business outcomes, but a core goal was always to make work better for engineers.

Frictionless

extends that same idea: start by identifying inefficiencies in the system, talk to developers about where their work is difficult, and you can improve both business outcomes and developer experience.

SPACE gave us a framework for measuring complex work like software development. Measurement is critical to any DevEx initiative, and we dedicate a full chapter to how AI is changing what we need to measure and how we should think about metrics differently.

But here’s the key difference:

Frictionless

goes beyond measurement. Metrics alone don’t create change. You also need to sell the initiative to leadership, advocate for change across your organization, plan communications, manage organizational change—all the messy, human work of actually making improvements happen. That’s what this book is designed to help with”.

2. Writing Process

It’s always interesting to learn what goes into writing a book. What made you both decide to take on this project?

Nicole:

“This is a great question, since I didn’t think I would write

another

book. However, I realized a couple of things after talking to teams and leaders across many companies and industries: there was increased attention upon, and a push to improve, developer experience. Also, many questions and challenges were very similar: how do I start, how do I prioritize, and how do I convince the business that DevEx is important?”

Abi:

“Over the past several years, I’ve worked hands-on with Developer Productivity (DevProd) leaders at hundreds of organizations. The same questions and challenges came up repeatedly, so a book felt inevitable. When Nicole reached out about teaming up in 2022, it was a no-brainer to finally make it happen. As a fun fact, I bought the domain developerexperiencebook.com in February 2021 – so about a year before we started writing the book!”

How long did the writing take?

Nicole:

“The whole process took about 3.5 years, but it wasn’t linear. I had a false start where I’d written several thousand words and realized it was way too pedantic; basically a research book with chapters explaining methods, but nothing immediately actionable. I scrapped it and started over.

This was the point when I reached out to Abi. We’d written a couple of papers together before, and his work at DX was giving him incredible insights into the key challenges teams face, and what actually works to improve DevEx. The combination is perfect: I brought the frameworks and experience from working with teams, and he brought the frontline practitioner perspective and patterns he was seeing across hundreds of companies.

Together, we built something practical: the step-by-step process, the workbooks, the real-world examples. Much better than my first attempt!”

Where did you get inspiration for the practices shared in the book?

Nicole:

“Honestly, it all comes from actual work: collaborating or advising actual teams and actual DevEx improvement projects”.

Abi:

“As Nicole mentioned, we didn’t go reaching for ideas or conduct research specifically for the book. Everything we put into it comes directly from our existing research and practical experience”.

What are your favorite parts of the book, and do any details stick out in particular?

Nicole:

“I love the section on treating metrics like a product. But if I had to pick one story, it’s how Dave Anderson was able to drive improvements at Amazon. What made it stick with me was how he could influence real change without authority by sharing a dashboard”.

Note from Gergely: longtime newsletter readers and podcast listeners may find Dave Anderson’s name familiar: he authored the popular guest post,

A Day in the Life of a Senior Manager at Amazon

, and has been a guest on the

Pragmatic Engineer podcast

.

Abi:

“Translating developer experience into business terms (Chapter 9) is a topic that’s especially meaningful to me. Developers – and most engineering leaders – instinctively understand how essential a strong developer experience is. But helping non-technical leaders see its strategic importance can be challenging.

In the chapter, we highlight the story of Mike Fisher, former CTO of Etsy, who led a transformative developer-experience initiative that not only accelerated engineering teams, but was backed by hard, quantifiable ROI”.

What has the feedback about the book been like, so far?

Nicole:

“It’s been really positive, overall. A lot of folks are finding ways to get unstuck, or engage with people at work in new ways. I’ve had a few folks insist the AI transformation will change everything, but the core of the book is really about how we build software, how to spot inefficiencies, and how to effect change.

And, as many of us are seeing, AI amplifies everything. Sometimes, it’s how much we can prototype and experiment, and other times, it’s our friction points and bottlenecks. So, while workflows may change, the fundamental importance of reducing friction doesn’t”.

Abi:

“Like shipping a product, putting a book out into the world is exciting and also nerve wracking! I’ve been grateful for all the support we’ve been receiving, as well as feedback.

I think this book lands at a critical moment for the industry. AI is creating enormous excitement and rapid change, and that makes the fundamentals of measurement and developer experience more important than ever”.

Frictionless

is organized into five parts:

Part I: Understanding DevEx

Part II: The three essential parts of DevEx (feedback loops, flow state, cognitive load)

Part III: Making the business case [to invest in DevEx]

Part IV: Improving DevEx: a 7-step process

Part V: Evolving and sustaining DevEx

With that, let’s jump into two full chapters of the book, from parts III and V.

3. Making the business case to reduce developer friction

Chapter 9 from Part III: Making the Business Case.

Understanding developer experience and its business impact is just the beginning. The real challenge is securing the resources and organizational support needed to make meaningful improvements. Most DevEx initiatives fail not because of poor technical execution, but because they can’t effectively communicate their value to decision-makers.

In this part, we explore how successful teams have translated developer pain points into compelling business cases that resonate with executives. You’ll learn how to connect DevEx improvements to financial outcomes, align with existing strategic priorities, and position your work as a solution to leadership’s most pressing concerns. These approaches are designed to be durable—while the specific tools and technologies you advocate for will evolve with AI and other innovations, the fundamental methods for investigating problems, gathering data, and communicating business value remain constant. Whether you’re seeking initial funding for DevEx improvements or defending existing investments, these chapters will show you proven approaches for building leadership support.

Translate developer experience into business value

C-suite executives speak the language of business outcomes.

While “improving developer satisfaction” or reducing lead times” might resonate with engineering leaders, executive decision-makers need to see clear connections to financial impact. Business leaders are evaluated on metrics like revenue growth, profitability, and market share—so your DevEx proposals must connect directly to these financial outcomes.

This doesn’t mean executives don’t care about developer well-being. Rather, they need to understand how developer experience investments translate to business results. This financial framing is crucial when selling your strategy (Step 5) and demonstrating value (Step 7).

Talk about

recovering time

: Convert developer hours into dollar value.

Developer time has clear financial value. You can:

Measure hours spent on unnecessary toil or waiting for builds/tests.

Multiply this time by the fully loaded hourly cost of developers.

Present these savings as “recaptured productivity dollars” or “free headcount.”

For example, if your team of 50 developers each wastes 5 hours weekly on build-related delays at a fully loaded cost of $100/hour, that’s $25,000 in weekly productivity losses—or $1.3 million annually.

Alternatively, express this as “free headcount,” for example, 50 developers × 5 hours lost weekly = 250 total hours wasted. Based on a 40-hour workweek, that’s equivalent to gaining 6.25 additional developers without increasing your budget. This framing resonates particularly well when hiring freezes are in place or during tight labor markets. To safeguard your credibility, be sure to actually measure real, credible time savings.

The financial impact is substantial. When teams improve developer experience, those benefits compound. A $250,000 developer who recovers just 10 percent of their time by avoiding tooling friction represents $25,000 in reclaimed value. Multiply that across an entire engineering organization, and it’s equivalent to dozens or hundreds of “free” developers.

But the benefits don’t stop there—faster toolchains enable organizations to build, experiment, and iterate more rapidly, creating business value that can climb into the millions. And that’s before accounting for the compounding effects on delivery timelines, team morale, and customer satisfaction.

Etsy’s $2.5M DevEx investment: A business case in action

As Etsy’s engineering team rapidly grew from 250 to nearly 1,000 developers, leadership recognized that productivity would suffer without investment in developer experience.

CTO Mike Fisher’s approach to securing buy-in was straightforward: Translate improvements into business language. Instead of explaining technical changes to deployment processes, he told executives the work would save 50 percent of engineering hours spent waiting for deployments—equivalent to a quarter of a full-time engineer’s salary. The result was an initiative that dedicated 20 percent of engineering capacity to improve DevEx in four key areas: Crafting products, developing and deploying, building with data, and reducing toil.

The initiative

, which took 18 months, was so successful that it led to ongoing investment in developer-experience work, integrated into Etsy’s standard operations. Their key insight: Scale people, process, and technology together, or productivity suffers regardless of growth.

Talk about

saving money

: Quantify cost savings

. Improved developer experience delivers tangible cost savings that directly impact your financial statements. By enhancing automation, streamlining workflows, and eliminating redundancies, you can substantially reduce operational expenses.

For example, strategic DevEx investments can:

Decrease vendor costs through process optimization and tool consolidation.

Reduce cloud computing expenses by improving test efficiency (eliminating redundant tests).

Lower infrastructure costs through optimized build processes that require less processing power.

Minimize expensive production incidents through better quality controls.

When making your business case, focus on these hard cost savings with specific projections whenever possible. This includes both the immediate savings from reduced delivery costs—as developers ship features faster with less friction—and the long-term savings from improved talent retention. Executives respond strongly to initiatives that demonstrate clear paths to expense reduction while maintaining or improving output quality.

Strategic standardization: How Block delivered millions in savings

Block is a leading fintech company made up of brands like Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Rather than pursuing standardization for its own sake, they centered their DevEx strategy on consolidating tools to create well-supported golden paths for developers.

When making their business case, Block’s team could have focused on abstract benefits such as developer satisfaction or code throughput. Instead, they focused on the dollar-impact that engineering friction and avoidable reliability incidents were having on the business..

The business-focused approach paid off. Their developer experience initiative was funded and delivered impressive results in 12 months. Thanks to investments in better developer environments, golden paths, and AI tooling, they saw millions of dollars in documented savings and double-digit improvements in developer satisfaction scores.

Talk about

making money

: Accelerating revenue through DevEx.

While developer experience initiatives aren’t direct revenue generators, they significantly accelerate your existing revenue streams. For software-driven companies, revenue growth depends on five key factors:

Feature velocity (how quickly new capabilities reach customers).

Feature quality (how well new capabilities meet customer needs).

Experimentation speed (how quickly you can test and iterate on new ideas).

Service reliability (how consistently your products perform).

Security posture (how well you protect customer data and trust).

All five factors depend on effective developer workflows. Consider the AI transformation, where companies racing to integrate AI capabilities into their products are pursuing increased revenue, competitive advantage, and expanded market share. However, these AI features must be:

Designed and coded.

Reviewed for quality.

Built and tested.

Integrated into existing systems and products.

Securely deployed.

Maintained and improved.

When developers wrestle with suboptimal tools and fragmented processes, these technical bottlenecks become business problems. Your company faces delayed market entry, compromised quality, and security vulnerabilities—all directly hitting revenue.

Consider this: If competitors release AI features quarterly while your team needs six months due to workflow inefficiencies, you’re not just accumulating technical debt, you’re experiencing actual revenue losses and diminishing market relevance. Smart DevEx investments create a multiplier effect where your existing teams deliver more value faster, enhancing revenue streams and capturing market opportunities before competitors do.

Accelerating revenue growth: Capital One’s DevEx transformation

Capital One dramatically transformed their market position by strategically investing in developer experience and cloud infrastructure.

Before their DevEx overhaul, launching new financial products took 6-9 months, limiting the company’s competitive agility. By standardizing development environments, implementing modern CI/CD pipelines, and embracing cloud-native technologies, Capital One slashed delivery times from months to weeks or days.

The business impact was fast and measurable. Faster deployment cycles meant Capital One could capture market opportunities before competitors, respond quickly to customer needs, and optimize revenue-generating features through rapid iteration.

Capital One secured executive buy-in by directly connecting their DevEx investments to accelerated time-to-market and customer acquisition—metrics that translate directly to revenue growth. Their story demonstrates how improving developer workflows isn’t just a technical win—it’s a powerful revenue accelerator.

Talk about

proven correlations

: Link technical metrics to business outcomes

. Sometimes the most powerful business cases come from identifying correlations between technical metrics and business outcomes.

In

How to Measure Anything

, Douglas Hubbard writes, “If you can correlate two things to each other, and then if you can correlate one of them to money, then you can express them both in terms of money.”

At eBay, a breakthrough analysis showed that every 10 millisecond improvement in page speed translated to millions of dollars in increased web purchases. This correlation transformed how the business viewed page speed—from a technical concern to a critical revenue driver deserving investment.

A specific example of this approach is the developer experience index (DXI), developed by DX. The DXI score is the average of 14 survey questions that ask developers about different aspects of their development process. By correlating this score against self-reported time loss, DX has found that each one-point gain in DXI score translates to saving 13 minutes per week per developer, equivalent to

10 hours annually

. This correlation allows organizations to predict financial impact from DevEx improvements.

You can apply this same approach to developer experience:

Correlate developer satisfaction scores with reduced time-to-market.

Link build system reliability to fewer production incidents.

Connect onboarding experience improvements to faster new-hire productivity.

However, be cautious of trying to tie a developer productivity metric straight to revenue—a common mistake in this space. DevEx leaders attempt this, they don’t know how to get started, and then they give up trying to convince their management of the value of their work.

Storytelling matters more than the exact numbers

When building your DevEx business case, perfect is the enemy of good. Many leaders get stuck trying to calculate perfectly precise ROI figures or collect perfect data. This perfectionism is rarely necessary.

In most situations, reasonably credible data is sufficient—what really matters is how you weave that data into a compelling narrative. While data points make good headlines or proof points, they need a clear, concise story to be meaningful to decision-makers.

Remember: Even the most impressive numbers rarely speak for themselves. Your presentation skills, narrative structure, and understanding of your audience’s priorities will ultimately determine whether your business case succeeds. We discuss this more in Step 5: Sell Your Strategy.

4. How AI changes (and doesn’t change) the metrics you need

The excerpt below is Chapter 59 from Part V: Evolving and Sustaining DevEx

AI changes what developers do every day, so your metrics need to change too.

The good news? The measurement fundamentals you just learned still apply. As AI tools become woven into daily development work, you’re probably wondering: “Do I need to throw out everything I know about measuring developer experience?” The short answer is no—but the longer answer is more interesting.

The fundamentals still matter.

The SPACE framework and DORA metrics remain relevant because developers still need fast builds, reliable deployments, good documentation, and strong collaboration—and AI often amplifies the pain of bad foundations rather than masking them. Flow and friction haven’t gone anywhere: Developers still need focus, and slow pipelines, flaky tests, and unclear ownership still break it. And while AI shifts what developers do, it doesn’t change their need for clarity, autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

Applying SPACE to AI-Augmented Development

In Chapter 58, we introduced the SPACE framework as a way to balance your metrics across five dimensions. That framework remains just as valuable when measuring AI-augmented workflows—you just need to ask slightly different questions:

Satisfaction

: How do developers feel about AI tools? Do the tools improve or frustrate their work experience? Are they satisfied with the quality of AI suggestions?

Performance

: Are outcomes improving with AI assistance? Track defect rates, feature completion times, and time-to-resolution for incidents.

Activity

: What are the AI usage patterns? Monitor suggestion acceptance rates, what types of work get delegated to AI, and where AI gets used most (tests, docs, debugging).

Communication

: How does AI affect collaboration? Are code reviews shifting from syntax to architecture? Are developers asking AI instead of peers? Is documentation improving or declining?

Efficiency

: Where does AI save time versus create overhead? Measure workflow changes, time saved on routine tasks, and friction from context gaps or validation effort.

Consider adding a sixth dimension: Trust. How much do developers trust AI-generated code, comments, and recommendations? This affects both adoption patterns and the value teams ultimately derive from AI tools.

AI doesn’t just speed up existing work—it changes workflows

. Developers aren’t just writing code; they’re reviewing, prompting, and steering AI. And here’s what most people miss: Most AI usage involves reasoning about information rather than generating it. Developers spend more time using AI to write summaries, compare alternatives, conduct smart searches, and synthesize research than generating code. This means existing metrics that capture time spent coding or lines of code written miss the bulk of AI-augmented work—the time spent crafting prompts, reviewing suggestions, and making decisions based on AI synthesis.

New metrics can help answer new, emerging questions. Track prompting efficiency—how many attempts developers need before getting a useful AI suggestion. Measure validation effort—the time spent reviewing and correcting AI-generated code, which reveals whether AI truly saves time or just shifts where developers spend it. And monitor trust calibration—when developers trust AI too much (shipping bugs) versus too little (wasting time double-checking correct code). These metrics reveal friction that traditional measures like commit frequency or lines changed simply can’t capture.

AI usage telemetry can reveal important patterns and changes in workflows. Capture what types of work developers do themselves versus what they hand off to AI agents—this shows where AI is valuable and may reveal new system blockers. Deep insights also come from watching how AI reshapes team dynamics: Are engineers asking AI instead of peers for help? Are code reviews shifting from syntax nitpicks to architecture discussions? Are new developers getting up to speed faster because AI explains your internal codebase?

Most importantly, collect this data thoughtfully. AI instrumentation typically involves much more detail than other methods. Aggregate at the team level rather than tracking individuals, be transparent about what you’re measuring and why, and work with HR and legal partners early to establish clear privacy boundaries. The goal is to improve developer experience, not create surveillance.

Your metrics product also needs to adapt. Create segmented views that compare AI and non-AI performance. Build feedback loops that reveal where AI adds the most value. And introduce visualizations that track how AI affects collaboration patterns.

Use AI to build your AI metrics

There’s a helpful irony here: While AI changes what you need to measure, it can also help you build that measurement infrastructure faster.

Use AI coding assistants to:

Generate data pipeline code for collecting AI telemetry

Create dashboard prototypes and visualizations

Write scripts to analyze prompt patterns and acceptance rates

Build data transformation logic for aggregating team-level metrics

What once required weeks of custom development can now be scaffolded in hours. Just remember to validate AI-generated code carefully—especially for instrumentation that feeds critical decisions. And leverage AI for the scaffolding and boilerplate, while keeping human expertise focused on the measurement strategy and interpretation.

Mixed methods become even more important with AI

. Logs tell you what AI suggested and what got accepted, but only surveys and interviews tell you why. Your telemetry might show developers rejecting 80% of AI suggestions for authentication code—but you need to talk to developers to learn whether that’s because AI hallucinates security vulnerabilities, doesn’t understand your internal frameworks, or because developers don’t trust it for security-critical work. The “what” reveals patterns; the “why” reveals the root cause and tells you what to fix.

The shift from output to outcomes becomes critical.

AI makes it painfully obvious that lines of code was always a bad metric—but more importantly, it forces us to connect our metrics to what actually matters. Developer productivity isn’t the goal; faster customer value delivery is. That means measuring problem-solving speed (time from idea to working solution), breadth of exploration (how many approaches developers can test), and cognitive load (whether AI helps or overwhelms). These outcome-focused metrics tell you what actually moves the needle on business value, not just code volume.

Behind the scenes, your infrastructure needs to evolve—and not just for developer workflows.

Traditional telemetry doesn’t capture AI interaction loops, so you need new instrumentation for prompting workflows, completions, and accept/reject events. These real-time metrics reveal patterns and friction that retrospective analysis can miss.

But don’t stop there—instrument agentic workflows too. Tracking what agents do reveals which tasks are best suited for automation and which require human judgment. It also shows how delegation to agents affects developers’ mental models of the system: Does offloading routine tasks free developers to think architecturally, or does it create blind spots where they lose understanding of how things work?

Start by auditing your existing metrics through an AI lens.

Ask: “Does this metric still capture what we care about?” and “What important tasks, workflows, and feedback loops does our data miss?” Don’t throw everything out and don’t start over from scratch—add data that fills important gaps and helps you answer new questions.

Your metrics strategy should also anticipate questions stakeholders will ask about AI adoption: “Where is AI providing the most value?” “Are we seeing quality trade-offs?” “Which teams are benefiting most?” Your metrics should answer these, not just operational velocity questions. Having these insights ready builds confidence in your AI implementation strategy while helping teams make better decisions about where and how to leverage these tools.

The bottom line: AI changes what you measure, but not why you measure it.

You’re still trying to understand and improve developer experience—the SPACE framework still applies, as shown in the callout above. The fundamentals remain sound; you just need new instruments to capture the new reality.

Before AI tools started to spread, larger tech companies invested in developer experience. Amazon calls this area “builder experience”, Spotify uses “R&D experience”, and other places use terms like “engineering experience”, or “maker experience” as per Frictionless.

With AI coding tools in use, there are expectations that productivity should increase for us devs – basically; assuming these AI tools are any good, products should be built faster, and iteration speed should improve. But we seem to be going back to basics in figuring out why this happens at some companies, but not at others.

Engineering leaders finally have a case for the resources of time and money to reduce/remove processes, improve tooling, and make developer experience better at both small and large teams.

I like Frictionless because it doesn’t talk about how to use AI differently or “better”: instead, it provides suggestions about removing annoying friction from devs’ day-to-day lives.

Thanks, Nicole and Abi for writing this book; hopefully it makes the case easier for reducing developer friction at your workplace, too!

Model Context Protocol (MCP)

was released almost exactly a year ago by Anthropic, and today, MCP is enjoying quite a moment, with strong growth in the numbers of devs building MCP servers. That might be related to MCP servers being a great way to give agents like Claude Code, Cursor Agent, and other LLMs new capabilities to use services, query documentation, and be more efficient. Adoption is widespread and diverse, across cutting-edge startups and regulated industries like aerospace alike.

One year on, how are engineering teams using this technology, and what does that teach us? To find out, we collected input from 46 software engineers who build and use MCP servers at work, and talked with

Jeremiah Lowin

, CEO of Prefect and creator of FastMCP, the leading MCP framework for Python, and

Den Delimarsky

, core MCP maintainer and Principal Engineer at Microsoft.

Thanks to everyone who shared their experience of building with MCP.

Today, we cover:

1. MCP fundamentals

The MCP protocol

was released

in November 2024 and was developed by two software engineers at Anthropic, David Soria Parra, and Justin Spahr-Summers, who started work on it that July.

The protocol aims to be the “USB-C” layer for AI applications. It’s a standardized protocol to connect Clients (chatbots, IDEs, AI applications) to Servers (data, files, and tools). Here’s how the protocol works, at a high level:

MCP protocol

With MCP, you can do handy things like:

Implement a ticket.

Tell the agent inside Cursor to implement TICKET-123 in Linear.

Interactive debugging.

Tell Claude Code to verify that the feature implemented in TICKET-123 in tools like Linear/JIRA works as expected, or by inspecting logs inside Sentry, Statsig, and other production systems.

Query databases.

Ask your agent running in the IDE: “How many new signups were there last week?” With a database MCP connector, the agent goes and writes the right query and returns the result.

For devs, a very practical use case is to add MCP servers for preferred agents, then instruct the agent to do more complicated workflows involving one of the added tools. Thanks to having access to tools via MCP –

boom!

– the agent becomes a lot more capable!

.

2. Usage realities

When it comes to MCP adoption, there’s a view that there are many times more MCP servers than users, as per a popular meme in the space:

MCP: Absence of users?

But the survey paints a nuanced picture, as shown by three unexpected details about the adoption:

#1: internal MCP server usage >> public MCP server usage.

FastMCP creator Jeremiah Lowin told us:

“One of the most interesting things that we [at Prefect] have observed is that we expected to see every company launch an MCP server, and that their customers would begin interacting with them in that way. But that is not what is happening. Many companies are

launching

MCP servers, but not publicly.

There are perhaps 10 MCP servers that are heavily used, from major developer-facing companies. Then, there’s this massive long tail of public servers with close to zero users, built for personal use.”

The public-facing server stats tally with what Prefect was seeing, of far higher adoption. They figured out that the reason was that most MCP servers stay internal-only and not in public.

#2: Business stakeholders are heavy MCP users.

Again, from Jeremiah:

“Turns out, MCP is being used especially heavily by internal data and platform teams to give internal users access to systems. These are systems that these users perhaps already had access to, but it was either too complex or too broad, or needed a lot of documentation or special skills to use.

We also came across interesting cases where users didn’t have access to a system because the team owning that service didn’t have a trusted way to build a workflow to make those tools available.

Almost every team that we talk to now is an internal team serving internal stakeholders, including non-engineers, and using MCP as the technology to do it.

My colleague recently said that he thinks that MCP will replace ‘Self-service Business Intelligence.’

This replacement is especially likely once there’s a really established way to just build dashboards from what comes out of it. It’s almost like the promise of

The Semantic Layer

in the data world is actually being realized through MCP in a way that never quite got out of the barn”.

#3: Median MCP user.

This user might be different from some expectations;

my initial idea of a dev using MCP is someone who connects a Linear or Figma MCP server to their agent to get things done faster. But Jeremiah says not:

“The median MCP user is someone who says something like: ‘I want to access my company’s own data warehouse through an MCP server’, and uses an internal MCP that they connect to the agent they’re using.”

This observation lines up with many MCP users not being developers; they’re business folks who want to generate reports and dashboards, and use MCP servers as connectors to internal systems.

So, what’s with the “more builders than users” opinion?

Jeremiah answered:

“If all I saw was external-facing tooling, then I would agree with the observation of there being more builders than consumers. In that case, I would see a sea of people promoting junk MCP servers to an audience of zero, and I would probably draw the same conclusion. But empirically, I disagree [with the meme above], based on the usage data I see: there are lots of internal MCP servers built, which are built to be used.”

This is probably it: the observation that most public MCP servers have few to zero users is correct, but it’s not the case that there are more MCP builders than users. Actually, most users are inside companies which makes them invisible.

A more accurate meme?

Why internal usage makes sense

MCP has many limitations currently which work against public-facing usage, such as:

Controlling both server and client.

When an MCP server is built internally, you know what the client will be, and build for that client. It might be an internal LLM application, or a tool the company uses. By controlling both the client and the server, you can build useful capabilities into the server. But when only controlling the server, the MCP server might need to be “dumbed down” to serve simple MCP clients.

Security

. Still an open-ended question – as covered below. For a protocol with security question marks, it’s safer to keep usage within the company firewall.

Elicitation

is a good example of when internal MCP servers make more sense than external ones. Jeremiah explains:

“Elicitation is like a confirmation in the middle of a tool call, to ask you to provide some structured input, like a ‘true’ or ‘false’ or ‘confirm’ or ‘cancel’, etc. And that’s great, and you can use that in your server. But if the client being used doesn’t support it, and most clients don’t support it, then you brick the entire conversation. So what do you do if you’re PayPal, at that scale? You choose not to use that feature, which you would think is the obvious thing to put into a confirmation of moving funds, or something. So, all of a sudden, you find your external use cases being boiled down to this lowest common denominator of client ability”.

3. How teams use MCP

There are an abundance of ways that teams are using MCP. A roundup of examples reported to us:

Better dev workflows

Connecting AI agents to ticketing systems and CI/CD systems is a common use case which devs shared with us:

GitHub MCP

is frequently mentioned for:

Interacting with a repo: create PRs, trigger Agent Copilot, search for release history, etc.

Working across several repos: at companies where projects are split across repositories, creating PRs that span many is easier with GitHub MCP.

AI agent + ticketing system.

A backend developer at a small startup shared with us: “The integration with Atlassian Rovo allows me to commit, push, and create a merge request in a single command with Claude Code.”

Substitute Atlassian with any ticketing system, or Claude Code with any agentic dev tool.

Unsurprisingly, internal MCP servers are a popular means for using dev tools. Here’s a software engineer on how they do it:

“We’ve only used internally built MCPs due to how much we tailor our API usages.

We’ve built our own MCP servers for GitHub, JIRA, Datadog, Buildkite and many others.

We are still engaging with them in new ways, but it’s reshaped how we work with agentic AI and integration with crafting sandboxes.”

MCP servers reduce context switching in these cases; previously, devs needed to context switch between the browser and IDE/CLI, whereas now they can do the same work by interacting with an agent. I’d say that the time and effort savings are minor, but us devs can be selectively lazy; so, if you can do it with a prompt, why switch between two or more tools!

From a ticket to a v1 version

Bootstrapping work is another common usage of MCP servers. Devs use the MCP server of their ticketing system and kick off a coding agent:

Linear MCP

:

“The Linear MCP allows us to simply paste in a link to an issue and ask an AI like Cursor or Claude Code to complete the ticket.”

– software engineer.

Confluence MCP:

“We use it to search for relevant documentation, update JIRA tasks, and read descriptions to bootstrap work.”

–

Lukas Kurucz

, React Native engineer at language learning platform Preply.

Atlassian + GitHub + Confluence MCP:

also from Lukas, a case of MCPs working together: “I use Atlassian MCP to create new documentation for changes based on PR on GitHub. Copilot will read code changes via GitHub MCP and create a doc on the changes in Confluence”.

Figma MCP

is a popular mention among devs in our research, with several using it to turn Figma designs into code. Figma offers

a hosted remote server

, and

a local server

that can be used with the Figma desktop app:

“The Figma MCP server has been handy for implementing Figma designs into React Native UI code. Cursor Agent mode, using the tools available on this server often does an excellent job of creating a first draft of code that can be improved in future agent loops. The official MCP from Figma has been consistent for me since I started with it, and uses the existing authentication from the Figma desktop app”. — Joshua Yoes, Staff Engineer at Infinite Red.

“Figma MCP is a good one — it works well with Jira Atlassian MCP to bootstrap work for new JIRA tasks”. – Lukas Kurucz.

Debugging

Connecting error tracking and observability tools is another popular use case:

Observability MCP server:

“We built an MCP server to access observability data. We are now pulling this observability data into Claude Code so that it can directly cross-reference errors with code changes and potential causes. Also, to analyze slowdowns / expensive database queries. That way, Claude Code has access to performance data and full schemas.” – Ben Blackmore, CTO, observability startup, Dash0.

Sentry MCP + Cursor:

“Sentry’s MCP server is fairly useful; I’ll give Cursor a link to a Sentry issue and ask it to troubleshoot and create a plan for fixing the issue.” — Principal engineer at a late-stage startup.

In-house Rollbar MCP

: “We paste in a link to a Rollbar issue (Rollbar is an error tracking service) and the AI is then able to read the stack trace of the error, find the exact line of code in our codebase, fix it, and push a PR. We built our own Rollbar MCP server because there wasn’t an official one at the time”. – Software engineer at a startup.

Testing

Running browser automations with MCPs

: using the MCP servers of browser automation frameworks like Playwright and Puppeteer is a no-brainer for some frontend devs:

“Browser automation via Playwright’s accessibility tree. Interact with and test web apps deterministically via MCP.” — Software engineer at a self-driving startup

“I’ve started using the Playwright MCP for giving the assistant context on what the frontend implementation looks like.” — Developer at a consultancy

“Puppeteer is helpful for UI changes; I’ll tell Cursor what local URL to visit and what it should see or what issues to look for.” — Andrew Minion, platform engineering manager at travel tech company iVisa

Making specialized testing options available to all devs:

a systems development engineer at a mid-sized company said:

“Chrome DevTools has powerful

automation capabilities

like recording and replaying user flows, getting performance insights, and doing advanced browser debugging like analyzing network requests on the fly. However, until recently, only a small portion of people familiar with UI automation could utilize this.

Thanks to

chrome-devtools-mcp

, now backend developers and even product managers can quickly experience its capabilities”.

New way of testing features?

Software engineer,

Theo Windebank

, described an interesting, new type of testing workflow at customer ops AI startup, Gradient Labs. It involves using a Notion database, Claude Code, and the Linear MCP:

“A flow that worked really well for us:

We built a new feature and got lots of people at the company to test it.

They added rows to a Notion database with their testing results and feedback.

I used Claude Code to create a new database with aggregated/categorized test results in it, grouped by underlying issue.

I iterated on that a bit manually in Notion, then used the Linear MCP to create a new project and filled it with tickets based on the rows in the aggregated database.

This all worked quite well: the agent often gets the parameters wrong, but then retries with corrections, which is kind of cool to watch”.

Mobile QA with the iOS Simulator MCP

: an interesting use case was shared by Staff Engineer Joshua Yoes, using the popular

iOS Simulator MCP

he created:

“I have found that if I give clear instructions for navigating a UI flow that I know works, the iOS Simulator MCP can be handy for automating the taking of screenshots of key screens and screen recordings of flows. Often, I need to include these in pull request descriptions in order for a reviewer to approve my code, so this has been a handy use case to speed it up. For some more complicated changes, I was able to successfully get 5 different screen recordings in one conversation with the agent”.

External documentation

Giving agents access to external documentation (like AWS docs) is a good trick for getting better coding results and fewer hallucinations.

Context7 MCP: a popular way to access external documentation.

Context7 MCP

was mentioned by several devs as the way they give agents access to up-to-date documentation:

“Context7 is a great tool for allowing the model to quickly fetch documentation about a tool”. — Federico Saravia, Head of Engineering at

letsmake.com

.

“On my team we use Context7 for up-to-date documentation, and see fewer hallucinated APIs and functions as a result”. — Wynand Pieters, consultant dev.

“We usually use Context7 to give external documentation access to agents”. – Andrew Eacott, Principal Engineer at Miro.

AWS Knowledge MCP server

is also handy, according to a software engineer at an autonomous driving startup:

“We use the Remote AWS Knowledge MCP via

Streamable HTTP

, proxied to standard input/output (stdio) for editor compatibility”.

Internal documentation

Opening up access to internal docs is also a common use case:

“The Notion MCP has been useful to open up internal docs

. We use these documents as context when creating product requirement documents to implement larger features in a React Native codebase. Sometimes, clients I work with will create style guides or tutorials for developers. Having Cursor use this Notion MCP is great for securely accessing internal Notion documents, and doing so without copy/pasting the entire contents of the article in an agent chat.” — Joshua Yoes, Staff Engineer at Infinite Red.

Building custom MCPs to access internal docs is common:

“We built an internal tool that serves DevEx knowledge (how-to guides, internal library documentation) to engineers working in agentic coding IDEs. It was very straightforward to build; we used

Spring AI

. The challenge is in optimising content served, not the MCP integration itself.” — Andrew Eacott, Principal Engineer at Miro

“I’ve built an MCP sharing information about our internal libraries: it suggests what internal library to use, lists all libraries, provides documentation of a library, and provides examples of use of a library”. — software engineer at a startup

Better context on legacy codebases.

A clever use case was shared by a Tech Lead at a SaaS company working in governmental technology:

“I developed my own MCP server for a project to give better context on legacy codebases to agents by providing an interface to search for similar implementation patterns, bugs, etc. It’s very helpful, so far”.

Internal service discovery

An MCP for a “services lookup” is a smart use case.

At GetYourGuide, the team built one to get service catalog information. Engineering Manager Harshal Shah shared:

“One of the internal MCP servers we have developed talks to our service catalog and answers questions such as ‘who owns a given service’, ‘which team does an individual belong to’, and so on”.

Working with legacy systems & complex libraries

A software engineer at an electric aviation company built an MCP server to pull data from complicated, legacy

Siemens Polarion ALM

software:

“We are building an MCP to surface documents from Siemens Polarion ALM for tracking aircraft requirements and airborne software development.

Accessing this legacy system with very poor integration points has always been a challenge, especially for AI tools.

But it’s also been a challenge to get documents out from this system to share with external users. Even now, access control due to the sensitive nature of the data is a really tough situation with the current MCP spec. Running the MCP server inside a trusted boundary works though – at least for now.”

Suggesting which internal libraries that agents should use

. Another engineer is working on an MCP specifically to provide more context on internal libraries:

“I’ve built an MCP server that shares information about our internal libraries: it suggests what internal library to use, lists all libraries, provides documentation of a library, and provides examples on how to use this library. It’s a handy MCP server”. — software engineer at a startup.

Giving non-devs more access

The GetYourGuide team is experimenting with surfacing more information to customer agents. From Harshal Shah, Engineering Manager at the company:

“One MCP implementation is over our GraphQL gateway. This server allows our customer care agents to get information more easily.  After initial testing, we found it useful and are rolling it out. This MCP helps answer questions such as ‘how many participants were in this booking?’ and ‘Have there been previous refunds for booking ID ###?’ We will expand the scope further to take bigger, bolder workflows in the coming months.”

Turning internal APIs into data sources for non-devs to use.

A Staff Geospatial Engineer at an aerospace company shared:

“Our MCPs help non-software engineers aggregate data from different services. These servers expose information from our API data services. We build National Catastrophe (NatCat) solutions (e.g. modeling the likelihood of the likes of earthquakes, floods, wildfires, etc), and we find it useful to have a GPT client feeding on our data so our non-developers can aggregate more data sources, more efficiently. So far, it’s working great!”

Allowing non-devs to contribute code

Kamlesh Chandnani is Director of Frontend at payment solutions provider, Razorpay. He shared how they’ve

open-sourced

their design system called ‘Blade’, and built

an MCP server

that can implement frontend UIs using this design system. The MCP server is also open source:

Components from

Razorpay’s design system

Kamlesh explained how the team uses this MCP for a few purposes:

Figma to code, with great results.

“Our Blade MCP server converts Figma designs to code. Just grab the Figma frame, paste a link into the server, and then without prompting, you get production-ready code. A few stats:

70%

of our frontend engineers have used it to build features without writing any single line of code.

75%

accuracy on the first generation, without prompting (we measure this using

evals

). Devs iterate on the rest.

3x:

devs reported shipping three times faster when building UIs from Figma designs.

We keep our Figma designs and code matching. For the release cycle of the design system, we only release a new component in Figma once the code for the component is released. We built tooling and scripts to validate the property structure on Figma. All this work seems to be paying off with accurate code generation.

Migrating existing code/UI to the new design system:

Blade MCP made it easier and faster. We’re now building an agentic workflow to make migration autonomous via agents”.

Something that got my attention is how Razorpay has opened up “vibe coding” to non-devs. Kamlesh, again:

“

This MCP acts as our ‘internal Lovable’ tool for PMs/designers/anyone else.

It enables all of these non-engineers to vibe code their ideas, using the design language of Razorpay, and take it to production.

Our issue with existing vibe coding tools was that they could not generate minimum viable products(MVPs) that follow the internal design guidelines and coding practices. But with our Blade MCP, we can scaffold a base template with our coding practices, and then the UI can be built using our design language, tested using Playwright MCP, and deployed using our DevOps MCP, so now it’s a lot easier to take apps prototyped like this to production”.

Internal MCP servers that keep evolving

A principal engineer at a startup shared an interesting emergent model of experimentation with MCP:

“I started off a project of setting up an internal agent with the expectation that it would just be used to triage tech support tickets. However, after I showed it to a few colleagues, everyone wanted to use it, and they all started using it for their own things.

The way that I see things progressing is that you share your internal server, and then it starts to shape up

. So, like me, you set up an agent with all of these MCP tools in various internal systems. At first, it’s a free-for-all: anyone can come and use it. But as people start using it more, repeatable workflows and effective prompts will begin to emerge, and we will extract and formalize those.

Some things will definitely stay loose and ad-hoc, of course. For example, one of the biggest use cases so far is just keeping ad-hoc data queries off of the plates of our data team. Before, they would interrupt us with things like “what do usage patterns for this new feature look like?”. Now, they can simply ask this of the agent that has our MCP connected to it”.

Many ways to use MCPs

The list of examples goes on, evidently. I reckon a lot of innovation is happening inside teams, with MCPs allowing devs to do things more easily, and for non-devs to get access to data, systems, and functionality.

External MCP servers and their relatively small usages don’t tell the whole story of what’s going on: within trusted boundaries where security is not a worry, they’re widely-used powerful components for working with agents.

In this episode

Michelle Lim

joined Warp as engineer number one and is now building her own startup,

Flint

. She brings a strong product-first mindset shaped by her time at Facebook, Slack, Robinhood, and Warp. Michelle shares why she chose Warp over safer offers, how she evaluates early-stage opportunities, and what she believes distinguishes great founding engineers.

Together, we cover how product-first engineers create value, why negotiating equity at early-stage startups requires a different approach, and why asking founders for references is a smart move. Michelle also shares lessons from building consumer and infrastructure products, how she thinks about tech stack choices, and how engineers can increase their impact by taking on work outside their job descriptions.

If you want to understand what founders look for in early engineers or how to grow into a founding-engineer role, this episode is full of practical advice backed by real examples.

An interesting quote from the episode

Michelle’s advice to be a standout founding engineer at an AI company:

Gergely: What would your advice be to software engineers who would love to join as a founding engineer, perhaps an AI startup  these days?

Michelle:

It’s about showing that you’ve built in AI before, because that skill is very much in high demand and it’s very new.

Very few people — relatively speaking — have ever built an AI product before. So just spending some time over the weekends knowing how to build an AI product already helps you stand out above many people. Build anything that scratches your itch that uses any of the models, or the completion APIs.

To excel in the role: it starts off with picking the right founder.

Once you do join, it’s all about volunteering to do the things that no one wants to do, but it’s the most important thing for the business.

So I wrote  blog posts, published them on Hacker News, and I answered all the questions on Hacker News. I went out there and I created our company Twitter, and I was writing tweets for the company. I then started a YouTube channel for the company before any developer tool companies really thought about doing YouTube. I started a Discord channel, filed all feedback, and did things outside of engineering that the business really needed.

You still have to make sure that you’re doing your number one job, which is software engineering.

That needs to still stay the main focus, and you should only volunteer for other stuff if you are already doing well in your main job.

The benefit of doing a lot of these things and learning how to do a lot of these things is that then you get to learn what businesses

need

https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/evals,A pragmatic guide to LLM evals for devs,Evals are a new toolset for any and all AI engineers – and software engineers should also know about them. Move from guesswork to a systematic engineering process for improving AI quality.,2026-01-04T04:06:53.232050,Gergely Orosz,"One word that keeps cropping up when I talk with software engineers who build large language model (LLM)-based solutions is “

evals

”. They use evaluations to verify that LLM solutions work well enough because LLMs are non-deterministic, meaning there’s no guarantee they’ll provide the same answer to the same question twice. This makes it more complicated to verify that things work according to spec than it does with other software, for which automated tests are available.

Evals feel like they are becoming a core part of the AI engineering toolset. And because they are also becoming part of CI/CD pipelines, we, software engineers, should understand them better — especially because we might need to use them sooner rather than later! So, what do good evals look like, and how should this non-deterministic-testing space be approached?

For directions, I turned to an expert on the topic,

Hamel Husain

. He’s worked as a Machine Learning engineer at companies including Airbnb and GitHub, and teaches the online course

AI Evals For Engineers & PMs

— the upcoming cohort

starts in January

. Hamel is currently writing a book,

Evals for AI Engineers

, to be published by O’Reilly next year.

In today’s issue, we cover:

Vibe-check development trap.

An agent appears to work well, but as soon as it is modified, it can’t be established that it’s working correctly.

Core workflow: error analysis

. Error analysis has been a key part of machine learning for decades and is useful for building LLM applications.

Building evals: the right tools for the job.

Use code-based evals for deterministic failures, and an LLM-as-judge for subjective cases.

Building an LLM-as-judge.

Avoid your LLM judge memorizing answers by partitioning your data and measuring how well the judge generalizes to unfamiliar data.

Align the judge, keep trust.

The LLM judge’s expertise needs to be validated against human expertise. Consider metrics like True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR).

Evals in practice: from CI/CD to production monitoring.

Use evals in the CI/CD pipeline, but use production data to continuously validate that they work as expected, too.

Flywheel of improvement.

Analyze → measure → Improve → automate → start again

With that, it’s over to Hamel:

1. Vibe-check development trap

Organizations are embedding LLMs into applications from customer service to content creation. Yet, unlike traditional software, LLM pipelines don’t produce deterministic outputs; their responses are often subjective and context-dependent. A response might be factually accurate but have the wrong tone, or sound persuasive while being completely wrong. This ambiguity makes evaluation fundamentally different from conventional software testing. The core challenge is to systematically measure the quality of our AI systems and diagnose their failures.

I recently worked with

NurtureBoss

, an AI startup building a leasing assistant for apartment property managers. The assistant helps with tour scheduling, answers routine tenant questions, and inbound sales. Here is a screenshot of how the product appears to customers:

The AI leasing assistant of NurtureBoss. Source:

nurtureboss.io

They had built a sophisticated agent, but the development process felt like guesswork: they’d change a prompt, test a few inputs, and if it “looked good to me” (LGTM), they’d ship it. This is the “vibes-based development” trap, and it’s where many AI projects go off the rails.

To understand why this happens, it helps to think of LLM development as bridging three fundamental gaps, or “gulfs”:

Gulf of Comprehension:

The gap between a developer and a true understanding of their data and the model’s behavior at scale. It’s impossible to manually read every user query and inspect every AI response to grasp the subtle ways a system might fail.

Gulf of Specification:

The gap between what we

want

the LLM to do, and what our prompts

actually instruct

it to do. LLMs cannot read our minds; an underspecified prompt forces them to guess our intent, leading to inconsistent outputs.

Gulf of Generalization:

The gap between a well-written prompt and the model’s ability to apply those instructions reliably across all possible inputs. Even with perfect instructions, a model can still fail on new or unusual data.

The “Three Gulfs” model of challenges in LLM pipeline development

Navigating these gulfs is the central task of an AI engineer. This is where a naive application of Test-Driven Development (TDD) often falls short. TDD works because for a given input, there is a single, deterministic, knowable, correct output to assert against. But with LLMs, that’s not true: ask an AI to draft an email, and there isn’t one right answer, but thousands.

The challenge isn’t just the “infinite surface area” of inputs; it’s the vast space of valid, subjective, and unpredictable outputs. Indeed, you can’t test for correctness before you’ve systematically observed the range of possible outputs and have defined what “good” even means for your product.

In this article, we walk through the pragmatic workflow we’ve applied at NurtureBoss, and at over 40 other companies, in order to move from guesswork to a repeatable engineering discipline. It is the same framework we’ve taught to over 3,000 engineers in our

AI Evals course

. By the end of this article, we’ll have gone through all the steps of what we call “the flywheel of improvement.”

A better alternative to vibes-based development of LLM apps, using evals

2. Core workflow: error analysis

To get past the LGTM trap, the NurtureBoss team adopted a new workflow, starting with a systematic review of their conversation traces. A trace is the complete record of an interaction: the initial user query, all intermediate LLM reasoning steps, any tool calls made, and the final user-facing response. It’s everything you need to reconstruct what actually happened. Below is a screenshot of what a trace might look like for NurtureBoss:

A trace rendered in

Arize Phoenix

, an open source LLM observability & eval tool

There are many ways to view traces, including with LLM-specific observability tools. Examples that I often come across in practice are

LangSmith

,

Arize

(pictured above), and

Braintrust

.

From raw notes to clear priorities

At first, it was an unglamorous process of manually using a trace viewer to review data. But as Jacob, the founder of NurtureBoss, reviewed traces, the friction became obvious. Off-the-shelf observability tools like LangSmith, Arize, Braintrust, and others offer decent ways to get started on reviewing data quickly, but are generic by design. For the NurtureBoss use case, it was cumbersome to view all necessary context, such as specific property data and client preferences on a single screen. This friction slowed them down.

Instead of fighting their tools, they invested a few hours in vibe coding a simple, custom data viewer using an AI assistant. It wasn’t fancy, but solved their core problems by showing each conversation clearly on one screen, with collapsible sections for tool calls and a simple text box for adding notes. Below is a screenshot of one of the screens in their data viewer:

Data viewer built by NurtureBoss. Building internal tools is a good use case for vibe-coding

This simple tool was a game-changer. It unlocked a significant improvement in review speed, allowing the team to get through hundreds of traces efficiently. With this higher throughput, they began adding open-ended notes on any behavior that felt wrong, a process known as

open coding

. When open coding, it is important to avoid predefined checklists of errors like “hallucination” or “toxicity”. Instead, let the data speak for itself, and jot down descriptive observations like:

“The agent missed a clear opportunity to re-engage a price-sensitive user.”

“It asked to send a text confirmation twice in a row.”

“Once the user asked to be transferred to a human, the agent kept trying to solve the problem instead of just making the handoff.”

After annotating dozens of conversations, NurtureBoss had amassed a rich, messy collection of notes. To find the signal amid the noise, they grouped these notes into themes in a step called

axial coding

. An LLM helped with the initial grouping of open codes into categories (aka the axial codes), which the team then reviewed and refined. A simple pivot table revealed that just three issues accounted for most problems: date handling, handoff failures, and conversation flow issues. This provided a clear, data-driven priority of failure modes in the application. Below is an illustration of what a partial view of this pivot table might look like, which is a count of failure categories:

Using axial coding to group open code into buckets

This bottom-up approach is the antidote to the problems of generic, off-the-shelf metrics. Many teams are tempted to grab a pre-built “hallucination score” or “helpfulness” eval, but in my experience, these metrics are often worse than useless. For instance, I recently worked with a mental health startup whose evaluation dashboard was filled with generic metrics like ‘helpfulness’ and ‘factuality,’ all rated on a 1-5 scale. While the scores looked impressive, they were unactionable; the team couldn’t tell what made a response a ‘3’ versus a ‘4,’ and the metrics didn’t correlate with what actually mattered to users.

They create a false sense of security, leading teams to optimize for scores that don’t actually correlate with user satisfaction. In contrast, by letting failure modes emerge from your own data, you ensure your evaluation efforts are focused on

real

problems.

This process of discovering failures from data isn’t a new trick invented for LLMs; it’s a battle-tested discipline known as

error analysis

, which has been a cornerstone of machine learning for decades, and is adapted from rigorous qualitative research methods like

grounded theory

in the social sciences. Next, let’s summarize this process into a step-by-step guide to apply to your problem.

Step-by-step guide to error analysis

This bottom-up process is the single highest-ROI activity in AI development. It ensures you’re solving real problems, not chasing vanity metrics. Here’s how to apply it:

Build a simple data viewer.

This is your most important investment. A custom web app, tailored to your domain, allows you to show all necessary context in one place and makes capturing feedback trivial.

Open coding: bottom-up annotation.

Open coding

(not to be confused with software coding) is a technique of writing open-ended notes about observed problems. In the context of LLMs, you review at least 100 diverse traces and add open-ended notes on any undesirable behavior. When reviewing a complex trace, the most effective tactic is to identify and annotate only the first upstream failure. LLM pipelines are causal systems; a single error in an early step like misinterpreting user intent often creates a cascade of downstream issues. Focusing on the first observable error is more efficient by preventing you from getting bogged down in cataloging every symptom. Often, fixing that single issue resolves an entire chain of subsequent failures.

Axial coding: create a taxonomy.

Now you have open-ended notes from step 2, it’s time to categorize them into buckets to understand the patterns. Group your open-ended notes into 5-10 themes. Use an LLM as an assistant to suggest initial clusters, but always have human review and refine the final categories.

Prioritize failures with data.

Use a simple pivot table or script to count the frequency of each failure mode. This transforms qualitative insights into a quantitative roadmap, revealing exactly where to focus engineering efforts.

A common question at this stage is: “what if there’s not enough real user data to analyze?” This is where

synthetic data

is a powerful tool. You can use a powerful LLM to generate a diverse set of realistic user queries that cover the scenarios and edge cases you want to test. This allows you to bootstrap the entire error analysis process before there’s a single user. The specifics of how to create high-quality, grounded synthetic data is a deep topic that’s beyond the scope of this article. It’s discussed in our

course

.

Below is a diagram illustrating the error analysis process:

The error analysis process visualized

3. Building evals: the right tool for the job

After error analysis, the NurtureBoss team had a clear, data-driven mandate to fix date handling and handoffs, based on the table of errors shown above. However, these things represent different kinds of failure: handling calendar dates is an objective outcome that can be measured against expected value, whereas the question of when to hand off a conversation to a human is more nuanced. This distinction is important because it determines the type of evaluator to build. We discuss the two types of evaluators you need to consider next: code-based assertions vs. LLM Judges.

For deterministic failures → code-based evals

A user query like “can I see the apartment on July 4th, 2026?” has one – and only one – correct interpretation. The AI’s job is to extract that date and put it into the right format for a downstream tool. This is a deterministic, objective task that’s either right or wrong.

Code-based evals are the perfect tool for simple failures. To build one, the NurtureBoss team first assembled a “golden dataset” of test cases. They brainstormed the many different ways users might ask about dates, focusing on common patterns and tricky edge cases. The goal was to create a comprehensive test suite that could reliably catch regressions.

Here’s a simplified version of what their dataset looked like. Note: For relative dates, we are assuming the current date is 2025-08- 28.

“Golden dataset” of test cases: The LLM is tested to ensure it returns the expected output

With this dataset, the evaluation process is straightforward and mirrors traditional unit testing. You loop through each row, pass the

User Query

to your AI system, and then run a simple function that asserts the AI’s extracted date matches the

Expected Output.

A code snippet showing a simple python function for a code-based eval

Code-based evals are cheaper to create and maintain

than other kinds of evals. Since there is an expected output, you only have to run the LLM to generate the answer, followed by a simple assertion. This means you can run these more often than other kinds of evals (for example, on every commit to prevent regressions). If a failure can be verified with code, always use a code-based eval.

For subjective failures → LLM-as-judge

But what about a more ambiguous problem, like knowing when to hand off a conversation to a human agent? If a user says, “I’m confused,” should the AI hand off immediately, or try to clarify things first? There’s no single right answer; it’s a judgment call based on product philosophy. A code-based test can’t evaluate this kind of nuance.

For subjective failures, we created another golden dataset. The domain expert, NurtureBoss’s founder, Jacob, reviewed traces where a handoff was potentially needed, and made judgment calls. In each case, he provided a binary PASS/FAIL score and, crucially, a detailed

critique

explaining his reasoning.

Here are a few examples from their dataset:

Example dataset for an LLM-as-judge eval.

Using a PASS/FAIL judgment works better than a points rating.

You’ll notice that in the example above, domain expert Jacob used a simple PASS/FAIL judgment for each trace, not a 1-5 points rating. This was a deliberate choice. I’ve learned that while it’s tempting to use a

Likert scale

to capture nuance; in practice, it creates more problems than it solves. The distinction between a “3” and a “4” is often subjective and inconsistent across different reviewers, leading to noisy, unreliable data.

In contrast, binary decisions force clarity and compel a domain expert to define a clear line between acceptable and unacceptable, focusing on what truly matters for users’ success. It’s also far more actionable for engineers: a “fail” is a clear signal to fix a bug, whereas a “3” is an ambiguous signal: a signal to do what, exactly? By starting with pass/fail, you cut through the ambiguity and get a clear, actionable measure of quality, faster.

This dataset of traces, judgments, and critiques does more than just help the team understand the problem. As we’ll see in the next section, these hand-labeled examples, especially the detailed critiques, become raw material for building a reliable LLM-as-judge.

4. Building an LLM-as-judge

The hand-labeled dataset of handoff failures is a necessary first step in measuring and solving handoff issues. But another issue is that manual review doesn’t scale. At NurtureBoss, the next step was to automate the domain expert’s expertise by building an LLM-as-judge: an AI evaluator that could apply his reasoning consistently to thousands of future traces.",https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com

As software engineers, what should we know about writing secure code?

Johannes Dahse

is the VP of Code Security at Sonar and a security expert with 20 years of industry experience. In today’s episode of

The Pragmatic Engineer,

he joins me to talk about what security teams actually do, what developers should own, and where real-world risk enters modern codebases.

We cover dependency risk, software composition analysis, CVEs, dynamic testing, and how everyday development practices affect security outcomes. Johannes also explains where AI meaningfully helps, where it introduces new failure modes, and why understanding the code you write and ship remains the most reliable defense.

If you build and ship software, this episode is a practical guide to thinking about code security under real-world engineering constraints.

Interesting quotes from the episode:

How code quality and code security are connected:

Gergely: “How does the quality of code relate to security?”

Johannes: “This is an underrated topic in the industry today. We talked about the null pointer exceptions or these slow regular expressions, right? That can lead to security issues. That’s more of the obvious examples of bugs.

Think about unreadable code, not well-maintained code: that’s often like spaghetti code. At first, it’s not so obvious how this is connected to security.

If you think about how code is not easy to comprehend, not easy to review. Then you do pair programming or code reviews in your development team — then in that spaghetti code, you will more likely overlook security problems of your colleague.

Now, maybe someone found an issue or and issue and reports it back to you. As a developer, you have to fix it. But if it’s not maintainable code, you cannot fix the security problem easily. So quality suddenly becomes a security issue in how the attacker window stays open longer!

Your code quality is super related to code security, especially now with AI-generated code.

We typically see poor quality of code here. And that becomes a problem for security.”

How AI is introducing new security issues:

Gergely: “How do you think AI is changing code security?”

Johannes: “We see a change in how code and applications are built. Traditionally, you had this backend/frontend split. In the backend, you had a database. Remove that database, then you don’t have a SQL injection risk anymore.

As soon as you add an LLM to the backend, you have to deal with prompt injection vulnerabilities.

The attacker can modify the system prompt or manage do some prompt engineering and then mess with the LLM’s logic or the output. It’s taking time both for the attackers to adjust to this, and the industry to adjust in defending against it.”

Gergely: “What about with coding assistance? Are you seeing things change in terms of how we think about code security?”

Johannes: “

The big problem [with AI coding assistance] in terms of security is that you produce code much more faster.

Writing code is not the challenge anymore. Suddenly, the new bottleneck is how are you verifying all that code, right? And if you don’t verify it:that leads to security issues or quality issues. Quality issues, on the long run, lead to security problems.”

On software composition analysis:

Gergely:

“What is

software composition analysis

(SCA)?”

Johannes: “It’s a technique where we look at manifest files and your list of dependencies, depending on the package manager you use. This list of dependencies is checked against a database of known security problems. Those are called the

CVEs

. Then you can - with software composition - map, for example, that this specific Log4j version of your library is vulnerable to the Log4 shell vulnerability that is known. And then it can warn you.”

It makes now a good time to start thinking about gifts, but techies can be a tough crowd for this, as we often already own the practical things we need.

In order to help you give gifts which are actually wanted this year, Elin, of this publication, and I have put together a list of ideas in this article. Alongside personal recommendations, we’ve also crowdsourced recommendations from fellow techies on

X

,

Bluesky

, and

Threads

, covering:

Office accessories

Computer add-ons

Health and well-being

Gadgets

Gaming and games

Travel & wearables

Books and stationery

Kitchen goodies

Many products listed below are currently discounted in the sales, and the Pragmatic Engineer is also offering a very special

Black Friday / Cyber Monday deal

for annual subscriptions.

Programming note: this week, we’ll have a podcast episode tomorrow (Wednesday), and no edition of The Pulse on Thursday. Regular programming resumes next week after Thanksgiving.

1. Office accessories

Ember Temperature Control Mug

– keeps coffee or tea warm, even when it’s forgotten about because you’re focused on coding or other tasks. A hot drink stays drinkable for up to 1.5 hours, thanks to its built-in battery that charges on a nifty wireless-charging coaster.

Clever: built-in battery keeps drinks warm

Tumblers and coffee mugs

that keep drinks at the desired temperature can make it easier to stay hydrated throughout the day. They are insulated, made from stainless steel, and make great gifts for anyone who works at a desk. Popular brands include

Stanley

,

Yeti

, and

Thermoflask

. You can also

search for

stainless steel tumblers.

Tumblers: hydration at work or during a commute

CO2 monitor.

One of my personal favorite recent purchases is a carbon dioxide monitor for my office. When CO2 concentration is high (above 1,000 ppm), it’s harder to focus and easier to become drowsy. A monitor detects when levels are raised, meaning you can make changes like open the window, or raise the matter of ventilation at work. In my opinion, you can’t go wrong with almost

any CO2 monitor

.

One of many CO2 detectors: the

SwitchBot CO2 detector

Programmable mini-desk terminal

. These are always a hit for devs, and a popular option is the

Ulanzi TC001 Smart Pixel Clock 2882

. It comes by default as a clock, but can be custom programmed; for example, to show a pomodoro timer (25-minute countdown).

Customizing the Ulanzi Smart Pixel Clock to work as a Pomodoro timer

To program it – and build your own custom matrix clocks – you need to flash a custom firmware

like AWTRIX3

. See more details on the

Ulanzi blog

, and on the AWTRIX3

getting started page

.

Wired / wireless charging stations.

Almost all new phones and small devices are shipping with USB-C ports, so a USB-C-only charging station is increasingly practical. There’s

no shortage of options

, and here’s a tasteful variant: the

Oakwood Dual Dock

Oakwood Dual Dock: a USB-C wired charging station

In his gift guide, Lenny Ratchisky

recommends

the

Belkin MagSafe 3-in-1 charger

.

2. Computer accessories

Techies unavoidably spend A LOT of time with our computers, so a premium accessory often makes for a good gift.

A comfortable mouse.

Given we use one all day, a mouse that feels good for your hand and that can be customized, should be a solid choice. The

Logitech MX Master 3

is recommended by software dev

Brian Cooley

. I’m personally a fan of

Logitech Mice

; they come in all shapes and sizes, with both wireless and wired versions.

Logitech MX Master 3

Quality noise-cancelling headphones.

These can offer a massive quality-of-work improvement for anyone in an open-plan office, coffee shops, or who likes to get in the zone with some music. My go-to pair is the

Bose QuietComfort Ultra

; I have one in the office, and one in my backpack at all times. Other popular options include the

Sony WH-1000XM5

, the

Apple AirPods Max

, and the

Sennheiser Momentum 4

.

The

Bose QuietComfort Ultra

Mechanical keyboard.

These provide superior typing and improved durability. A popular brand is Das

Keyboard

. Other choices include

Logitech mechanical keyboards

, the quiet

Razer Pro Type Ultra

, and

many others

.

Das Keyboard 6

Quality microphone.

For those who spend a lot of time on video calls, upgrading from the built-in laptop mic can be a nice improvement for those on the other end of a call.

The Shure MV7

is a popular choice. For a more compact microphone, the

Yeti Nano

can also work well.

Shure MV7

3. Health and well-being

Massage vouchers.

Most of us working in tech spend too much time staring at screens, so a massage voucher should be appreciated.

Experiences.

Of course, a great gift doesn’t have to be an object, and a few less conventional ideas have been successes with techies, according to

Candy Evans

:

Walking with alpacas

Making French pastries

Whisky tasting

There is much more, like

high rope courses

,

indoor skydiving

, and even

bobsledding

. Get creative: it could make for something very memorable!

Founder Chris Evans

said

the best gift he has given was a bobsled experience. Pic: Olympic bobsledding for the public at

La Plagne, France

Escape rooms

are a fun activity, usually for groups of 2-6. You need to solve a series of puzzles, usually within an hour, and work together to succeed under pressure of the countdown.

An escape room I enjoyed with a group:

The Vault

, in Amsterdam

“Escape room in a box”

is a companion concept, where you have an escape room experience at home, as a board game focused on puzzle solving.

WHOOP subscription

.

A return recommendation from last year: track biometrics such as skin temperature, blood oxygen level, and more. The battery lasts more than 2 weeks, and a subscription offers the option to upgrade to the latest models.

WHOOP band

Coffee, tea, matcha.

These are rarely a miss and many vendors offer subscription coffee or tea products. Here are two personal recommendations:

Terminal

: coffee subscription for devs, built by devs, accessible from your terminal. It has

an API as well

, and you can place an order using SSH. Ships to the US.

Keats&Co

– coffee and tea, including subscription. All profits go to charity.

Coffee delivered by Terminal. Pic:

Andy Leclair

Apple Watch Ultra

.

I got mine this year and am very happy with it. It provides basic sleep tracking, workout tracking, and notifications – and also supports payments (very convenient on vacation, or if you want to be phone-free.) It motivated me to take sleep and workouts more seriously. The battery lasts around 2 days – much less than the Whoop, but I find it manageable.

Apple Watch Ultra 2. Image source:

Outdoor Gearlab

Sunbasin soap and shampoo bars

. These offer a lathery, soapy clean, and the shampoo comes in bar form, which is novel and makes it convenient for travel.

Sunbasin bars

Sunrise alarm clock.

Wake up easier with an alarm clock that simulates a sunrise. One popular edition is the

Philips SmartSleep Wake-up Light

. There is a large variety; just

search “sunrise alarm clocks”.

A few different Sunrise alarm clocks. Source:

No Sleepless Nights

Foldable walking pad.

I have one at home, and it’s been a moderate success. I originally tried it as an under-the-desk walking pad – which was

okay

, but I felt dizzy when walking at higher speeds for extended periods. Nonetheless, plenty of techies swear by its efficiency, and they’re increasingly affordable. Just

search “walking pads”

for options.

The

WalkingPad A1 Pro

4. Gadgets

Flipper Zero.

When I ask techies about gifts they’ve enjoyed, the number one recommendation is still the Flipper Zero

from two years ago

. A multi-tool for security folks and those who enjoy hacking around with signals and hardware. Practical use cases include turning it into a universal infrared remote, a Bluetooth remote, and testing and debugging remote frequency (RF) gear like car key fobs with it. It’s also a great way to get hands-on with RF, NFC/RFID and embedded protocols, and basic firmware development.

The Flipper Zero

Boox Palma 2

. Phone-sized tablets with e-ink that also

kind of

work like a phone – except without phone calls and SMS support. It runs open Android and has Google Play support. So, you can install and use Android apps on a minimalist device that also helps with being more mindful about screentime. It has integrated speakers, a camera, Bluetooth – and the Palma Pro 2 model actually does support a SIM card for cellular data.

Boox Palma 2

Daylight DC-1

. An Android-based computer designed for deep focus and well-being. Uses a reflective “Live Paper” LCD display with a blue-light-free experience. It’s designed to minimize eye strain and support better sleep health. Includes backlighting.

The Daylight DC-1

reMarkable Paper Tablet

– touted as a replacement for notebooks and other books, which enables handwriting and annotating of PDFs. It has around two weeks of battery life, and does not include backlighting.

The reMarkable Paper Tablet

Supernote writing tablet

— a digital notebook, and frequently cited as an alternative to the reMarkable, offering similar functionality. Read a

comparison between the two

and more experiences shared on the

Supernote Reddit forum.

The Supernote

Small 3D printer.

Practical things techies can print include cable organizers, monitor risers, mouse trays, or tool holders for the desk. But then, there’s so much more you can do, as it can print pretty much any 3D model! A popular recommendation is the

Bambu Lab A1 Mini 3D Printer

.

The Bambu Lab A1 Mini 3D Printer

Pixel dice.

A nice gift for tabletop gamers. Edit how the dice behaves and lights up with a companion app. The

hardware engineering details behind the dice

are an interesting read.

How the Pixel Dice is constructed

YubiKey.

A hardware two-factor authentication passkey that is generally more secure than app-based 2FA, and also more resistant to phishing. If you plan to gift one, it’s worth giving two, so the person setting up the Yubikey

has a backup key

– with key services like email, banking, and others – in case it gets lost.

YubiKey: small and supports both USB-C and Lightning

JetKVM

– control your computer remotely, with a low latency of 30-60ms. KVM stands for Keyboard, Video, Mouse: this open source gadget lets you control your machine at home, over the internet.

Read a review of this gadget

.

JetKVM: Control your computer from anywhere

5. Gaming

Nintendo Switch 2

– an upgrade on its predecessor with better performance, more storage, and an improved Joy-Con design. It has a wide range of games, and likely the biggest collection of family-friendly and collaborative games, like Mario Party.

Switch 2, played with a standalone controller. Source:

Gizmodo

ModRetro Chromatic

. A Game Boy-like device created by Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus and Anduril. Each game comes on a cartridge, just like with old handhelds.

ModRetro Chromatic: Game Boy vibes

The game catalog is smaller than ideal – but in July this year, Luckey shared big plans,

writing

:

“We have a huge slate of content coming from some of the best developers in the industry, starting with an all-new physical Tetris cartridge that will come bundled with each and every Chromatic, just as it did with every original Game Boy® released in North America. We will also be launching all-physical re-releases and remasters of classic Game Boy® titles, entirely new IP from incredible indie developers, first-time launches of Game Boy® games that were canceled before release, and even some titles that were canceled before the public ever found out about them.”

Playdate

. A tiny-handled homage to old-school gaming. The crank on the side brings a new type of gaming experience, and the platform is home to lots of clever indie games. This device has become a family favorite in our home, and was also a recommendation in the

2023 gift guide

.

The Playdate 2. Source:

Ars Technica

Board games.

Playing board games is a great group activity. A recent guest on the

Pragmatic Engineer Podcast

, Martin Fowler, is a big fan of them, so I asked which one he recommends. He said:

“It’s a tricky one because it’s a little bit like saying ‘I’m really into watching movies. Which one would you recommend?’ There are so many different tastes.

If I wanted to pick one that is not too complicated to get into, but still has a lot of richness: at the moment I would pick the game Concordia. Fairly abstract in its nature, but it’s easy to get into and it’s got a good bit of decision making in the process.”

Concordia

– recommended by Martin Fowler

6. Travel & wearables

A light, sturdy backpack for commuting.

Tom Karlo, PM at Meta,

recommends

the

Dyneema Daypack

as light and durable.

The Dyneema Daypack

Cadence magnetic travel containers

. Leakproof travel-size jars for storing liquids like shampoo, body wash, and vitamins, or even jewelry. Both the jar and the lid are magnetic, making them easy to keep track of. Very useful when travelling, and also handy at home.

Cadence travel containers

Bellroy Tech Kit

– a pouch for keeping cables, an adapter, and a mouse, in one place when traveling.

The Bellroy Tech Kit

Meta glasses

. Launched in September, these are the best smart glasses on the market. A review by The Verge

concluded

that they offer better battery life, but “still have the tricky issue of being a camera, right on your face.”

Meta Glasses with armband

It’s new technology, novel, and something many techies might not get for themselves, but which could definitely be interesting for AR enthusiasts. Software engineer Alvin Sng – who works at Factory AI –

used his pair

to record a “day in the life” video at Factory AI.

Watch the full video

Airtags

. Always a useful gift for friends or family in the Apple ecosystem for tracking objects and also wandering kids. Obvious use cases include luggage, keys, autos, and more.

Airtags keep track of stuff

Car jump starter + power bank + flashlight.

I got one of these when my car’s battery died, and it’s been around ever since. It’s my go-to power bank when I need to plug something in, and serves as a reserve flashlight.

Helpful when there’s a power outage, or the car won’t start

7. Books and stationery

Books

are always a great gift for the holidays, when there’s usually more time to read. Specifically for tech, I previously shared

100+ recommendations

. Since that article, a few books have been published that I’ve enjoyed:

A selection from my bookshelf

Analog TO-DO list

.

Analog is an offline TO-DO system that works like this:

Write 10 tasks on a “Today” card at the beginning of the day

Mark tasks as “in progress”, “delegated” or “completed”

Move unfinished tasks either to a new “Today” card, or to a “Next” or “Someday” card

With so many digital TO-DO lists, an offline version feels refreshing!

8. Kitchen goodies

One place to escape the screen is the kitchen, and, although it’s not an obvious source of gift ideas for techies, there are many cool kitchen gadgets that are useful, day-to-day.

The Scizza

. If scissors and a pizza slicer had a baby, it would be the Scizza. We got one from a friend, and it has become a family favorite, and a source of amusement for guests – followed by “where can I get one?”

The Scizza

Soda machine.

Why buy soda when you can make your own and choose the flavours? There’s a growing selection of domestic soda makers like

Sodastream

, and

Aarke

, which is more high-end and looks gorgeous.

Takeaways

I hope this list of seasonal gift ideas is useful. For tech professionals, the perfect gift doesn’t have to be a cool gadget; it could equally be something that pulls us away from the screen! And in keeping with the sentimental tone of the season, perhaps the best gift of all which we can give is spending time with those we care about most.

Cloud Load Balancer Cheat Sheet

Efficient load balancing is vital for optimizing the performance and availability of your applications in the cloud.

However, managing load balancers can be overwhelming, given the various types and configuration options available.

In today's multi-cloud landscape, mastering load balancing is essential to ensure seamless user experiences and maximize resource utilization, especially when orchestrating applications across multiple cloud providers. Having the right knowledge is key to overcoming these challenges and achieving consistent, reliable application delivery.

In selecting the appropriate load balancer type, it's essential to consider factors such as application traffic patterns, scalability requirements, and security considerations. By carefully evaluating your specific use case, you can make informed decisions that enhance your cloud infrastructure's efficiency and reliability.

This Cloud Load Balancer cheat sheet would help you in simplifying the decision-making process and helping you implement the most effective load balancing strategy for your cloud-based applications.

Over to you: What factors do you believe are most crucial in choosing the right load balancer type for your applications?

How CQRS Works?

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) separates write (Command) and read (Query) operations for better scalability and maintainability.

Here’s how it works:

The client sends a command to update the system state. A Command Handler validates and executes logic using the Domain Model.

Changes are saved in the Write Database and can also be saved to an Event Store. Events are emitted to update the Read Model asynchronously.

The projections are stored in the Read Database. This database is eventually consistent with the Write Database.

On the query side, the client sends a query to retrieve data.

A Query Handler fetches data from the Read Database, which contains precomputed projections.

Results are returned to the client without hitting the write model or the write database.

Over to you: What else will you add to understand CQRS?

How does Docker Work?

Docker’s architecture is built around three main components that work together to build, distribute, and run containers.

Docker Client

This is the interface through which users interact with Docker. It sends commands (such as build, pull, run, push) to the Docker Daemon using the Docker API.

Docker Host

This is where the Docker Daemon runs. It manages images, containers, networks, and volumes, and is responsible for building and running applications.

Docker Registry

The storage system for Docker images. Public registries like Docker Hub or private registries allow pulling and pushing images.

Over to you: Do you use Docker in your projects?

6 Practical AWS Lambda Application Patterns You Must Know

AWS Lambda pioneered the serverless paradigm, allowing developers to run code without provisioning, managing, or scaling servers. Let’s look at a few practical application patterns you can implement using Lambda.

On-Demand Media Transformation

Whenever a user requests an image from S3 in a format that isn’t available, an on-demand transformation can be done using AWS Lambda.

Multiple Data Format from Single Source

AWS Lambda can work with SNS to create a layer where data can be processed in the required format before sending to the storage layer.

Real-time Data Processing

Create a Kinesis stream and corresponding Lambda function to process different types of data (clickstream, logs, location tracking, or transactions) from your application.

Change Data Capture

Amazon DynamoDB can be integrated with AWS Lambda to respond to database events (inserts, updates, and deletes) in the DynamoDB streams.

Serverless Image Processing

Process and recognize images in a serverless manner using AWS Lambda. Integrate with AWS Step Functions for better workflow management.

Automated Stored Procedure

Invoke Lambda as a stored procedure to trigger functionality before/after some operations are performed on a particular database table.

Over to you: Have you used AWS Lambda in your project?

Containerization Explained: From Build to Runtime

“Build once, run anywhere.” That’s the promise of containerization, and here’s how it actually works:

Build Flow: Everything starts with a Dockerfile, which defines how your app should be built. When you run docker build, it creates a Docker Image containing:

Your code

The required dependencies

Necessary libraries

This image is portable. You can move it across environments, and it’ll behave the same way, whether on your local machine, a CI server, or in the cloud.

Runtime Architecture: When you run the image, it becomes a Container, an isolated environment that executes the application. Multiple containers can run on the same host, each with its own filesystem, process space, and network stack.

The Container Engine (like Docker, containerd, CRI-O, or Podman) manages:

The container lifecycle

Networking and isolation

Resource allocation

All containers share the Host OS kernel, sitting on top of the hardware. That’s how containerization achieves both consistency and efficiency, light like processes, but isolated like VMs.

Over to you: When deploying apps, do you prefer Docker, containerd, or Podman, and why?

At its core, a broker decouples producers of information from consumers, allowing them to operate independently without direct knowledge of each other. This decoupling is foundational to modern distributed architectures, where services communicate through the broker rather than directly with one another, enabling them to evolve independently without tight coupling.

To understand this in practice, consider an order-processing service that places an “Order Placed” message on a broker. Downstream services such as inventory, billing, and shipping will get that message from the broker when they are ready to process it, rather than the order service calling each one synchronously. This approach eliminates the need for the order service to know about or wait for these downstream systems.

Message brokers are not merely pipes for data transmission. They are sophisticated distributed databases specialized for functionalities such as stream processing and task distribution. The fundamental value proposition of a message broker lies in its ability to introduce a temporal buffer between distinct systems. By allowing a producer to emit a message without waiting for a consumer to process it, the broker facilitates temporal decoupling. This ensures that a spike in traffic at the ingress point does not immediately overwhelm downstream services.

In this article, we will look at how message brokers work in detail and explore the various patterns they enable in distributed system design.

Imagine teaching a computer to recognize objects not by showing it millions of labeled photos, but by letting it browse the internet and learn from how people naturally describe images. That’s exactly what OpenAI’s CLIP does, and it represents a fundamental shift in how we teach machines to understand visual content.

CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) is a neural network that connects vision and language. Released in January 2021, it can classify images into any categories you want without being specifically trained for that task. Just tell it what you’re looking for in plain English, and it can recognize it. This “zero-shot” capability makes CLIP different from almost every computer vision system that came before it.

In this article, we will look at how CLIP works and the problems it tries to solve.

The Problem CLIP Solves

Traditional computer vision followed a rigid formula. If you want a model to distinguish cats from dogs, you need thousands of labeled photos. For different car models, you need another expensive dataset. For reference, ImageNet, one of the most famous image datasets, required over 25,000 workers to label 14 million images.

This approach created three major problems:

First, datasets were expensive and time-consuming to build.

Second, models became narrow specialists. An ImageNet model could recognize 1,000 categories, but adapting it to new tasks required collecting more data and retraining.

Third, models could “cheat” by optimizing for specific benchmarks.

For example, a model achieving 76% accuracy on ImageNet might drop to 37% on sketches of the same objects, or plummet to 2.7% on slightly modified images. Models learned ImageNet’s quirks rather than truly understanding visual concepts.

CLIP’s approach is radically different. Instead of training on carefully labeled datasets, it learns from 400 million image-text pairs collected from across the internet. These pairs are everywhere online: Instagram photos with captions, news articles with images, product listings with descriptions, and Wikipedia entries with pictures. People naturally write text that describes, explains, or comments on images, creating an enormous source of training data.

However, CLIP doesn’t try to predict specific category labels. Instead, it learns to match images with their corresponding text descriptions. During training, CLIP sees an image and a huge batch of text snippets (32,768 at a time). Its job is to determine which text snippet best matches the image.

Think of it as a massive matching game. For example, we show the system a photo of a golden retriever playing in a park. Among 32,768 text options, only one is correct: maybe “a golden retriever playing fetch in the park.” The other 32,767 options might include “a black cat sleeping,” “a mountain landscape at sunset,” “a person eating pizza,” and thousands of other descriptions. To consistently pick the right match across millions of such examples, CLIP must learn what objects, scenes, actions, and attributes look like and how they correspond to language.

By solving this matching task over and over with incredibly diverse internet data, CLIP develops a deep understanding of visual concepts and their linguistic descriptions. For example, it might learn that furry, four-legged animals with wagging tails correspond to words like “dog” and “puppy”. It might learn that orange and pink skies over water relate to “sunset” and “beach.” In other words, it builds a rich mental model connecting the visual and linguistic worlds.

The Technical Foundation

Under the hood, CLIP uses two separate neural networks working in tandem: an image encoder and a text encoder.

The image encoder takes raw pixels and converts them into a numerical vector (called an embedding). The text encoder takes words and sentences and also outputs a vector. The key insight is that both encoders output vectors in the same dimensional space, making them directly comparable.

Initially, these encoders may produce completely random, meaningless vectors. For example, an image of a dog might become [0.2, -0.7, 0.3, ...] while the text “dog” becomes [-0.5, 0.1, 0.9, ...]. These numbers have no relationship whatsoever. But here’s where training works its magic.

The training process uses what’s called a contrastive loss function. This is simply a mathematical way of measuring how wrong the model currently is. For correct image-text pairs (like a dog image with “dog playing fetch”), the loss function says these embeddings should be very similar. For incorrect pairs (like a dog image with “cat sleeping”), it says they should be very different. The loss function produces a single number representing the total error across all images and texts in a batch.

See the diagram below:

Then comes backpropagation, the fundamental learning mechanism in neural networks. It calculates exactly how each weight in both encoders should change to reduce this error. The weights update slightly, and the process repeats millions of times with different batches of data. Gradually, both encoders learn to produce similar vectors for matching concepts. For example, images of dogs start producing vectors near where the text encoder puts the word “dog”.

In other words, through the continuous pressure to match correct pairs and separate incorrect ones across millions of diverse examples, the encoders evolve to speak the same language.

Zero-Shot Classification in Action

Once CLIP is trained, its zero-shot capabilities become evident. Suppose we want to classify images as containing either dogs or cats. We don’t need to retrain CLIP or show it labeled examples.

Instead, we can simply take the image and pass it through the image encoder to get an embedding. Next, we can take the text “a photo of a dog” and pass it through the text encoder to get another embedding. Further on, we can take the text “a photo of a cat” and get a third embedding. Compare which text embedding is closer to the image embedding, which would be the answer.

See the diagram below:

OpenAI Research Blog

CLIP is essentially asking: “Based on everything learned from the internet, would this image more likely appear with text about dogs or text about cats?”

Since it learned from such diverse data, this approach works for nearly any classification task you can describe in words.

Want to classify types of food? Use “a photo of pizza,” “a photo of sushi,” “a photo of tacos” as your categories. Need to analyze satellite imagery? Try “a satellite photo of a forest,” “a satellite photo of a city,” “a satellite photo of farmland.” Working with medical images? You could use “an X-ray showing pneumonia” versus “an X-ray of healthy lungs.” You just change the text descriptions. No retraining required.

This flexibility is transformative. Traditional models needed extensive labeled datasets for each new task. CLIP can tackle new tasks immediately, limited only by your ability to describe categories in natural language.

Design Choices That Made CLIP Possible

CLIP’s success wasn’t just about the core idea. OpenAI made two critical technical decisions that made training computationally feasible.

First, they chose contrastive learning over the more obvious approach of training the model to generate image captions. Early experiments tried teaching systems to look at images and produce full text descriptions word by word, similar to how language models generate text. While intuitive, this approach proved incredibly slow and computationally expensive. Generating entire sentences requires much more computation than simply learning to match images with text. Contrastive learning turned out to be 4 to 10 times more efficient for achieving good zero-shot performance.

Second, they adopted Vision Transformers for the image encoder. Transformers, the architecture behind GPT and BERT, had already revolutionized natural language processing. Applying them to images (treating image patches like words in a sentence) provided another 3x computational efficiency gain over traditional convolutional neural networks like ResNet.

OpenAI Research Blog

Combined, these choices meant CLIP could be trained on 256 GPUs for two weeks, similar to other large-scale vision models of the time, rather than requiring astronomically more compute.

Conclusion

OpenAI tested CLIP on over 30 different datasets covering diverse tasks: fine-grained classification, optical character recognition, action recognition, geographic localization, and satellite imagery analysis.

The results validated CLIP’s approach. While matching ResNet-50’s 76.2% accuracy on standard ImageNet, CLIP outperformed the best publicly available ImageNet model on 20 out of 26 transfer learning benchmarks. More importantly, CLIP maintained strong performance on stress tests where traditional models collapsed. On ImageNet Sketch, CLIP achieved 60.2% versus ResNet’s 25.2%. On adversarial examples, CLIP scored 77.1% compared to ResNet’s 2.7%.

OpenAI Research Blog

However, the model still struggles with some things, such as:

Tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning or counting. It also has difficulty with very fine-grained distinctions, like differentiating between similar car models or aircraft variants where subtle details matter.

When tested on handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset (a task considered trivial in computer vision), CLIP achieved only 88% accuracy, well below the 99.75% human performance.

CLIP exhibits sensitivity to how you phrase your text prompts. Sometimes it requires trial and error (”prompt engineering”) to find wording that works well.

CLIP inherits biases from its internet training data. The way we phrase categories can dramatically influence model behavior in problematic ways.

However, despite the limitations, CLIP demonstrates that the approach powering recent breakthroughs in natural language processing (learning from massive amounts of internet text) can transfer to computer vision. Just as GPT models learned to perform diverse language tasks by training on internet text, CLIP learned diverse visual tasks by training on internet image-text pairs.

Since its release, CLIP has become foundational infrastructure across the AI industry. It’s fully open source, catalyzing widespread adoption. Modern text-to-image systems like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E use CLIP-like models to understand text prompts. Companies employ it for image search, content moderation, and recommendations.

Common Network Protocols Every Engineer Should Know

Ever wonder what actually happens when you click ""Send"" on an email or join a video call? Every click, message, and API call on the internet relies on network protocols. They define how data moves, who can talk, and how securely it all happens.

At the foundation are transport protocols: TCP ensures reliable delivery, UDP prioritizes speed, and QUIC brings both worlds together over UDP.

On top of that, HTTP powers the web, TLS secures it, and DNS translates names into addresses.

Need remote access? That’s SSH. File transfers? SFTP or SMB.

Real-time chat and media? WebSocket, WebRTC, and MQTT keep data flowing live.

For identity and access, OAuth and OpenID handle authorization and authentication.

In the backend, DHCP, NTP, ICMPv6, and LDAP quietly keep everything synchronized, addressed, and discoverable.

From simple emails (SMTP, IMAP) to encrypted VPNs (WireGuard, IPsec), these protocols form the invisible language that keeps the internet connected and secure.

Over to you: If one protocol suddenly stopped working worldwide, which one would break the internet first?

Special thanks to the Shopify engineering team for sharing details with us about their Black Friday Cyber Monday preparation work and also for reviewing the final article before publication. All credit for the technical details shared in this article goes to the Shopify Engineering Team.

Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) 2024 was massive for Shopify. The platform processed 57.3 petabytes of data, handled 10.5 trillion database queries, and peaked at 284 million requests per minute on its edge network. On app servers alone, they handled 80 million requests per minute while pushing 12 terabytes of data every minute on Black Friday.

Here’s the interesting part: this level of traffic is now the baseline for Shopify. And BFCM 2025  was even bigger, serving 90 petabytes of data, handling 1.75 trillion database writes with peak performance at 489 million requests per minute. This is why Shopify rebuilt its entire BFCM readiness program from scratch.

The preparation involved thousands of engineers working for nine months, running five major scale tests.

In this article, we will look at how Shopify prepared for success during the Super Bowl of commerce

The Three-Track Framework

Shopify’s BFCM preparation started in March with a multi-region strategy on Google Cloud.

The engineering team organized the work into three parallel tracks that run simultaneously and influence each other:

Capacity Planning involves modeling traffic patterns using historical data and merchant growth projections. The team submits these estimates to their cloud providers early so the providers can ensure they have enough physical infrastructure available. This planning defines how much computing power Shopify needs and where it needs to be located geographically.

The Infrastructure Roadmap is where the team reviews their technology stack, evaluates what architectural changes are needed, and identifies system upgrades required to hit their target capacity. This track helps sequence all the work ahead. Importantly, Shopify never uses BFCM as a release deadline. Every architectural change and migration happens months before the critical window.

Risk Assessments use “What Could Go Wrong” exercises to document failure scenarios. The team sets escalation priorities and generates inputs for what they call Game Days. This intelligence helps them test and harden systems well in advance.

These three tracks constantly feed into each other. For example, risk findings might reveal capacity gaps the team didn’t account for. Infrastructure changes might introduce new risks that need assessment. In other words, it’s a continuous feedback loop.

Game Days

To assess risks properly, the Shopify engineering team runs Game Days. These are chaos engineering exercises that intentionally simulate production failures at the BFCM scale.

The team started hosting Game Days in early spring. This involves deliberately injecting faults into the systems to test how they respond under failure conditions. Think of it like a fire drill, but for software.

During these Game Days, the engineering team focuses extra attention on what they call “critical journeys”. These are the most business-critical paths through their platform: checkout, payment processing, order creation, and fulfillment. If these break during BFCM, merchants lose sales immediately.

Critical Journey Game Days run cross-system disaster simulations. Here are some common aspects that are tested by the team:

The team tests search and pages endpoints while randomizing navigation to mimic real user behavior. They inject network faults and latency to see what happens when services can’t communicate quickly.

They bust caches to create realistic load patterns instead of the artificially fast responses you get when everything is cached.

Frontend teams run bug bashes during these exercises. They identify regressions, test critical user flows, and validate that the user experience holds up under peak load conditions.

These exercises build muscle memory for incident response by exposing gaps in operational playbooks and monitoring tools.

Most importantly, Shopify closes those gaps well ahead of BFCM instead of discovering them when merchants need the platform most. All findings from Game Days feed into what Shopify calls the Resiliency Matrix. This is centralized documentation that tracks vulnerabilities, incident response procedures, and fixes across the entire platform.

The Resiliency Matrix includes five key components.

First is service status, showing the current operational state of all critical services.

Second is failure scenarios that document how things can break and what the impact would be.

Third is recovery procedures, listing expected recovery time objectives and detailed runbooks for fixing issues.

Fourth is operational playbooks with step-by-step incident response guides.

Fifth is on-call coverage showing team schedules and PagerDuty escalation paths.

The Matrix becomes the roadmap for system hardening before BFCM. Teams update it continuously throughout the year, documenting resilience improvements as they go.

Load Testing with Genghis and Toxiproxy

Game Days test components in isolation, but Shopify also needs to know if the entire platform can handle BFCM volumes. That’s where load testing comes in.

The engineering team built a tool called Genghis that runs scripted workflows mimicking real user behavior. It simulates browsing, adding items to the cart, and going through checkout flows. The tool gradually ramps up traffic until something breaks, which helps the team find their actual capacity limits.

Tests run on production infrastructure simultaneously from three Google Cloud regions: us-central, us-east, and europe-west4. This simulates global traffic patterns accurately. Genghis also injects flash sale bursts on top of baseline load to test peak capacity scenarios.

Shopify pairs Genghis with Toxiproxy, an open-source framework they built for simulating network conditions. Toxiproxy injects network failures and partitions that prevent services from reaching each other. For reference, a network partition is when two parts of your system lose the ability to communicate, even though both are still running.

During tests, teams monitor dashboards in real time and are ready to abort if systems begin to degrade. Multiple teams coordinate to find and fix bottlenecks as they emerge.

When load testing reveals limits, teams have three options:

Horizontal scaling means adding more instances of the application.

Vertical scaling means giving each instance more resources, such as CPU and memory.

Optimizations mean making architecture-level changes that improve performance, ranging from better database queries to performance tuning across consuming layers up to the frontend.

These decisions set the final BFCM capacity and drive optimization work across Shopify’s entire stack. The key insight is that the team cannot wait until BFCM to discover the capacity limits. It takes months of preparation to scale infrastructure and optimize code.

The Analytics Platform Challenge

BFCM tests every system at Shopify, but 2025 presented a unique challenge. Part of their infrastructure had never experienced holiday traffic, which creates a problem: how do you prepare for peak load when you have no historical data to model from?

In 2024, Shopify’s engineering team rebuilt its entire analytics platform. They created new ETL pipelines. ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load, which is the process of pulling data from various sources, processing it, and storing it somewhere useful. They also switched the persistence layer and replaced their legacy system with completely new APIs.

This created an asymmetry. The ETL pipelines ran through BFCM 2024, so the team had one full season of production data showing how those pipelines perform under holiday load. But their API layer launched after peak season ended. They were preparing for BFCM on APIs that had never seen holiday traffic.

This matters a lot because during BFCM, merchants obsessively check their analytics. They want real-time sales numbers, conversion rates, traffic patterns, and data about popular products. Every single one of these queries hits the API layer. If those APIs can’t handle the load, merchants lose visibility during their most critical sales period.

Shopify ran Game Days specifically for the analytics infrastructure. These were controlled experiments designed to reveal failure modes and bottlenecks. The team simulated increased traffic loads, introduced database latency, and tested cache failures to systematically map how the system behaves under stress.

The results showed four critical issues that needed fixes:

First, the ETL pipelines needed Kafka partition increases to maintain data freshness during traffic spikes. Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that handles real-time data flows. More partitions mean more parallel processing, which keeps data fresh for the APIs to serve.

Second, the API layer memory usage required optimization. The team found this through profiling, which means measuring exactly how the code uses memory. Each API request was using too much memory. Under high load, this would cause out-of-memory errors, slower response times, or complete crashes.

Third, connection timeouts needed tuning to prevent pool exhaustion. A connection pool is a set of reusable database connections. Creating new connections is expensive, so applications reuse them. The problem was that timeouts were too long, meaning connections would get stuck waiting. Under high load, you run out of available connections, and new requests start failing. Shopify tuned the timeouts to release connections faster.

Fourth, the team split API requests through a different load balancer approach. Originally, API requests would all enqueue to one region, which added latency and load. By scaling up the secondary region’s cluster and updating the load balancing policy,  they better distributed the work and prevented API servers from being overwhelmed.

Beyond the performance fixes, the team validated alerting and documented response procedures. Their teams were trained and prepared to handle failures during the actual event.

The Scale Tests

Game Days and load testing prepare individual components, but scale testing is different. It validates the entire platform working together at BFCM volumes, revealing issues that only surface when everything runs at capacity simultaneously.

From April through October, Shopify ran five major scale tests at their forecasted traffic levels, specifically their peak p90 traffic assumptions. In statistics, p90 means the 90th percentile, or the traffic level that 90% of requests will be below.

Here are the details of those scale tests:

The first two tests validated baseline performance against 2024’s actual numbers.

Tests three through five ramped up to 2025 projections, targeting 150% of last year’s load.

By the fourth test, Shopify hit 146 million requests per minute and over 80,000 checkouts per minute. On the final test of the year, they tested their p99 scenario, which reached 200 million requests per minute.

These tests are extraordinarily large, and therefore, Shopify runs them at night and coordinates with YouTube because the tests impact shared cloud infrastructure. The team tested resilience, not just raw load capacity. They executed regional failovers, evacuating traffic from core US and EU regions to validate their disaster recovery procedures actually work.

Shopify ran four types of tests:

Architecture scale-up tests validated that their infrastructure handles planned capacity.

Load tests during normal operations established baseline performance at peak load.

Load tests with failover validated disaster recovery and cross-region failover capabilities.

Game Day simulations tested cross-system resilience through chaos engineering.

The team simulated real user behavior, such as storefront browsing and checkout, admin API traffic from apps and integrations, analytics and reporting loads, and backend webhook processing. They also tested critical scenarios like sustained peak load, regional failover, and cascading failures where multiple systems fail simultaneously.

Each test cycle identified issues that would never appear under steady-state load, and the team fixed each issue as it emerged. Some of the key issues were as follows:

Scale Tests 1 and 2 revealed that under heavy load, core operations threw errors, and checkout queues backed up.

Scale Test 3 validated key migrations and confirmed that regional routing behaved as expected after infrastructure changes.

Scale Test 4 hit limits that triggered an unplanned failover, identifying priority issues in test traffic routing and discovering delays when bringing regions back online during rebalancing.

Scale Test 5 performed a full dress rehearsal and was the only test run during North American business hours to simulate real BFCM conditions. All the other tests ran at night.

Mid-program, Shopify made an important shift. They added authenticated checkout flows to their test scenarios. Modeling real logged-in buyers exposed rate-limiting code paths that anonymous browsing never touches. Even though authenticated flows were a small percentage of traffic, they revealed bottlenecks that would have caused problems during the real event.

BFCM Weekend Operations

BFCM preparation gets Shopify ready, but operational excellence keeps them steady when traffic actually spikes.

The operational plan coordinates engineering teams, incident response, and live system tuning. Here are the key components of this plan:

The plan for BFCM weekend includes real-time monitoring with dashboard visibility across all regions and automated alerts.

For incident response, Incident Manager OnCall teams provide 24/7 coverage with clear escalation paths.

Merchant communications ensure stores get status updates and notifications about any issues.

Live optimization allows system tuning based on real-time traffic patterns as they develop.

After BFCM ends, the post-mortem process correlates monitoring data with actual merchant outcomes to understand what worked and what needs improvement.

The philosophy is simple: preparation gets you ready, but operational excellence keeps you steady.

Conclusion

Shopify’s 2025 BFCM readiness program shows what systematic preparation looks like at scale. Thousands of engineers worked for nine months, running five major scale tests that pushed their infrastructure to 150% of expected load. They executed regional failovers, ran chaos engineering exercises, documented system vulnerabilities, and hardened systems with updated runbooks before merchants needed them.

What makes this different from typical pre-launch preparation is the systematic approach. Most companies load test once, maybe twice, fix critical bugs, and hope for the best. Shopify spent nine months continuously testing, finding breaking points, fixing issues, and validating that the fixes actually work.

Also, the tools Shopify built aren’t temporary BFCM scaffolding. The Resiliency Matrix, Critical Journey Game Days, and real-time adaptive forecasting became permanent infrastructure improvements. They make Shopify more resilient every day, not just during peak season.

To provide a visualization of BFCM, Shopify also launched an interesting pinball game to showcase the Shopify Live Globe. The game itself runs at 120fps in a browser with a full 3d environment, physics engine, and VR Support. Behind the scenes, the game is a three[dot]js app built with “react-three-fiber”. Every merchant sale shows up a few seconds later on this globe. Everyone can check out the game and the visualization on the homepage for

For a long time, AI systems were specialists confined to a single sense. For example:

Computer vision models could identify objects in photographs, but couldn’t describe what they saw.

Natural language processing systems could write eloquent prose but remained blind to images.

Audio processing models could transcribe speech, but had no visual context.

This fragmentation represented a fundamental departure from how humans experience the world. Human cognition is inherently multimodal. We don’t just read text or just see images. We simultaneously observe facial expressions while listening to the tone of voice. We connect the visual shape of a dog with the sound of a bark and the written word “dog.”

To create AI that truly operates in the real world, these separated sensory channels needed to converge.

Multimodal Large Language Models represent this convergence. For example, GPT-4o can respond to voice input in just 232 milliseconds, matching human conversation speed. Google’s Gemini can process an entire hour of video in a single prompt.

These capabilities emerge from a single unified neural network that can see, hear, and read simultaneously.

But how does a single AI system understand such fundamentally different types of data? In this article, we try to answer this question.

A Shared Mathematical Language

The core breakthrough behind multimodal LLMs is quite simple. Every type of input, whether text, images, or audio, gets converted into the same type of mathematical representation called embedding vectors. Just as human brains convert light photons, sound waves, and written symbols into uniform neural signals, multimodal LLMs convert diverse data types into vectors that occupy the same mathematical space.

Let us consider a concrete example. A photograph of a dog, the spoken word “dog,” and the written text “dog” all get transformed into points in a high-dimensional mathematical space. These points cluster together, close to each other, because they represent the same concept.

This unified representation enables what researchers call cross-modal reasoning. The model can understand that a barking sound, a photo of a golden retriever, and the sentence “the dog is happy” all relate to the same underlying concept. The model doesn’t need separate systems for each modality. Instead, it processes everything through a single architecture that treats visual patches and audio segments just like text tokens.

The Three-Part Architecture: Building Blocks of Multimodal LLM

The diagram below shows the high-level view of a multimodal LLM works:

Modern multimodal LLMs consist of three essential components working together to process diverse inputs.

Modality-Specific Encoders

The first component handles the translation of raw sensory data into initial mathematical representations.

Vision Transformers process images by treating them like sentences, dividing photographs into small patches and processing each patch as if it were a word.

Audio encoders convert sound waves into spectrograms, which are visual-like representations showing how frequencies change over time.

These encoders are typically pre-trained on massive datasets to become highly skilled at their specific tasks.

Projection Layers: The Translator

The second component acts as a bridge. Even though both encoders produce vectors, these vectors exist in different mathematical spaces. In other words, the vision encoder’s representation of “cat” lives in a different geometric region than the language model’s representation of the word “cat.”

Projection layers align these different representations into the shared space where the language model operates. Often, these projectors are surprisingly simple, sometimes just a linear transformation or a small two-layer neural network. Despite their simplicity, they’re crucial for enabling the model to understand visual and auditory concepts.

Language Model Backbone

The third component is the core LLM, such as GPT or LLaMA.

This is the “brain” that does the actual reasoning and generates responses. It receives all inputs as sequences of tokens, whether those tokens originated from text, image patches, or audio segments.

The language model treats them identically, processing everything through the same transformer architecture that powers text-only models. This unified processing is what allows the model to reason across modalities as naturally as it handles pure text.

See the diagram below that shows the transformers architecture:

How Images Become Something an LLM Can Understand

The breakthrough that enabled modern multimodal vision came from a 2020 paper with a memorable title: “An Image is Worth 16x16 Words.” This paper introduced the idea of processing images exactly like sentences by treating small patches as tokens.

The process works through several steps:

First, the image gets divided into a grid of fixed-size patches, typically 16x16 pixels each.

A standard 224x224 pixel image becomes approximately 196 distinct patches, each representing a small square region.

Each patch is flattened from a 2D grid into a 1D vector of numbers representing pixel intensities.

Positional embeddings are added so the model knows where each patch came from in the original image.

These patch embeddings flow through transformer layers, where attention mechanisms allow patches to learn from each other.

The attention mechanism is where understanding emerges. A patch showing a dog’s ear learns it connects to nearby patches showing the dog’s face and body. Patches depicting a beach scene learn to associate with each other to represent the broader context of sand and water. By the final layer, these visual tokens carry rich contextual information. The model doesn’t just see “brown pixels” but understands “golden retriever sitting on beach.”

OpenAI CLIP

The second critical innovation was CLIP, developed by OpenAI. CLIP revolutionized how vision encoders are trained by changing the fundamental objective. Instead of training on labeled image categories, CLIP was trained on 400 million pairs of images and their text captions from the internet.

CLIP uses a contrastive learning approach. Given a batch of image-text pairs, it computes embeddings for all images and all text descriptions. The goal is to maximize the similarity between embeddings of correct image-text pairs while minimizing similarity between incorrect pairings. An image of a dog should produce a vector close to the caption “a dog in the park” but far from “a plate of pasta.”

How Audio Becomes Understandable

Audio presents unique challenges for language models.

Unlike text, which naturally divides into discrete words, or images, which can be divided into spatial patches, sound is continuous and temporal. For example, a 30-second audio clip sampled at 16,000 Hz contains 480,000 individual data points. Feeding this massive stream of numbers directly into a transformer is computationally impossible and inefficient. The solution requires converting audio into a more tractable representation.

The key innovation is transforming audio into spectrograms, which are essentially images of sound. The process involves several mathematical transformations:

The long audio signal gets sliced into tiny overlapping windows, typically 25 milliseconds each.

A Fast Fourier Transform extracts which frequencies are present in each window

These frequencies are mapped onto the mel scale, which matches human hearing sensitivity by giving more resolution to lower frequencies

The result is a 2D heat map where time runs along one axis, frequency along the other, and color intensity represents volume

This mel-spectrogram looks like an image to the AI model. For a 30-second clip, this might produce an 80x3,000 grid, which is essentially a visual representation of acoustic patterns that can be processed similarly to photographs.

Once audio is converted to a spectrogram, models can apply the same techniques used for vision. The Audio Spectrogram Transformer divides the spectrogram into patches, just as an image is divided. For example, models like Whisper, trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual audio, excel at this transformation.

The Training Process

The training process goes through different stages:

Stage 1: Feature Alignment

Training a multimodal LLM typically happens in two distinct stages.

The first stage focuses purely on alignment, teaching the model that visual and textual representations of the same concept should be similar. During this stage, both the pre-trained vision encoder and the pre-trained language model remain frozen. Only the projection layer’s weights get updated through training.

Stage 2: Visual Instruction Tuning

Alignment alone isn’t sufficient for practical use. A model might describe what’s in an image but fail at complex tasks like “Why does the person look sad?” or “Compare the two charts”.

Visual instruction tuning addresses this by training the model to follow sophisticated multimodal instructions.

During this stage, the projection layer continues training and the language model is also updated, often using parameter-efficient methods. The training data shifts to instruction-response datasets formatted as conversations.

An important innovation here was using GPT-4 to generate synthetic training data. Researchers fed GPT-4 textual descriptions of images and prompted it to create realistic conversations about those images. Training on this synthetic but high-quality data effectively distills GPT-4’s reasoning capabilities into the multimodal model, teaching it to engage in nuanced visual dialogue rather than just describing what it sees.

Conclusion

Multimodal LLMs achieve their remarkable capabilities through a unifying principle. By converting all inputs into sequences of embedding vectors that occupy a shared mathematical space, a single transformer architecture can reason across modalities as fluidly as it processes language alone.

The architectural innovations powering this capability represent genuine advances: Vision Transformers treating images as visual sentences, contrastive learning aligning modalities without explicit labels, and cross-attention enabling selective information retrieval across different data types.

The future points toward any-to-any models that can both understand and generate all modalities. In other words, a model that outputs text, generates images, and synthesizes speech in a single response.

Evolution of HTTP

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has evolved over the years to meet the needs of modern applications, from simple text delivery to high-performance, real-time experiences.

Here is how HTTP has progressed:

HTTP/0.9: Built to fetch simple HTML documents with a single GET request.

HTTP/1.0: Added headers and status codes to support richer interactions, but every request still required a new connection.

HTTP/1.1: Introduced persistent connections and more methods, making the web faster and more efficient for everyday browsing.

HTTP/2: Solved performance bottlenecks with multiplexing, enabling multiple requests to share one connection.

HTTP/3 (QUIC): Shifted to UDP with QUIC to reduce latency and improve reliability, especially for mobile and real-time apps.

Over to you: Are you already taking advantage of HTTP/3 in your projects?

System Performance Metrics Every Engineer Should Know

Your API is slow. But how slow, exactly? You need numbers. Real metrics that tell you what's actually broken and where to fix it.

Here are the four core metrics every engineer should know when analyzing system performance:

Queries Per Second (QPS): How many incoming requests your system handles per second. Your server gets 1,000 requests in one second? That's 1,000 QPS. Sounds straightforward until you realize most systems can't sustain their peak QPS for long without things starting to break.

Transactions Per Second (TPS): How many completed transactions your system processes per second. A transaction includes the full round trip, i.e., the request goes out, hits the database, and comes back with a response.

TPS tells you about actual work completed, not just requests received. This is what your business cares about.

Concurrency: How many simultaneous active requests your system is handling at any given moment. You could have 100 requests per second, but if each takes 5 seconds to complete, you're actually handling 500 concurrent requests at once.

High concurrency means you need more resources, better connection pooling, and smarter thread management.

Response Time (RT): The elapsed time from when a request starts until the response is received. Measured at both the client level and server level.

A simple relationship ties them all together: QPS = Concurrency ÷ Average Response Time

More concurrency or lower response time = higher throughput.

Over to you: When you analyze performance, which metric do you look at first, QPS, TPS, or Response Time?

Why Is Nginx So Popular?

Apache dominated web servers for 20 years, then Nginx showed up and changed everything. Now Nginx powers some of the largest sites on the internet, including Netflix, Airbnb, Dropbox, and WordPress. com. Not because it's newer or trendier, but because it solves problems that Apache couldn't handle efficiently.

Here’s what makes Nginx so popular:

High-Performance Web Server

Reverse Proxy & Load Balancer

Caching Layer

SSL Termination (Offloading)

Over to you: What’s your primary use for Nginx today, web server, reverse proxy, or load balancer?

Network Debugging Commands Every Engineer Should Know

When someone says “It’s a network issue,” these commands help you find what’s wrong fast.

ping: Checks if the destination responds and reports the round-trip time for basic reachability.

traceroute / tracert: Shows each hop on the path so you can see where packets slow down or stop.

mtr / pathping: Continuously measures latency and loss per hop to catch intermittent issues.

ip addr, ip link / ipconfig /all: Prints local IPs, MACs, and interface status so you can verify the machine’s network identity.

ip route: Reveals the routing table to confirm which gateway and next hop the system will use.

ip neigh: Displays IP-to-MAC entries to detect duplicates or stale ARP records on the LAN.

ss -tulpn: Lists listening sockets and PIDs so you can confirm a service is actually bound to the expected port.

dig: Resolves DNS records to verify the exact IPs clients will connect to.

curl -I: Fetches only HTTP(S) headers to check status codes, redirects, and cache settings.

tcpdump / tshark: Captures packets so you can inspect real traffic and validate what’s sent and received.

iperf3: Measures end-to-end throughput between two hosts to separate bandwidth limits from app issues.

ssh: Opens a secure shell on the remote machine to run checks and apply fixes directly.

sftp: Transfers files securely so you can pull logs or push artifacts during an incident.

nmap: Scans open ports and probes versions to confirm which services are exposed and responding.

Over to you: What's your go-to command when debugging network issues?

Hub, Switch, & Router Explained

Every home and office network relies on these three devices, hub, switch, and router, yet their roles are often mixed up.

A hub operates at Layer 1 (Physical Layer). It’s the simplest of the three, it doesn’t understand addresses or data types. When a packet arrives, it simply broadcasts it to every connected device, creating one big collision domain. That means all devices compete for the same bandwidth, making hubs inefficient in modern networks.

A switch works at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer). It learns MAC addresses and forwards frames only to the correct destination device. Each port on a switch acts as its own collision domain, improving efficiency and speeding up communication within a LAN.

A router operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer). It routes packets based on IP addresses and connects different networks together, for example, your home network to the Internet. Each router interface forms a separate broadcast domain, keeping local and external traffic isolated.

Understanding how these three layers work together is the foundation of every modern network, from your home Wi-Fi to the global Internet backbone.

Over to you: How do you usually figure out whether a network issue is caused by the router or the switch?

Aside from a catastrophic hardware failure or a process crash, the execution of a function is essentially guaranteed. If the process is alive, the call succeeds.

However, in distributed systems, this guarantee does not hold. Components communicate over physical networks that are inherently unreliable. This reality is captured in the “Fallacies of Distributed Computing,” specifically the first fallacy: “The network is reliable”. In truth, it is not. A request sent from Service A to Service B may fail not because Service B is broken, but simply because the communication medium momentarily faltered.

This creates a need for defensive programming patterns, and one of the primary mechanisms we use is the Retry pattern. By automatically retrying a failed operation, a system can trade latency for availability, turning what would have been a failed user request into a successful one.

However, retries are both essential and dangerous in distributed systems. On the one hand, they transform unreliable networks into reliable ones. But on the other hand, indiscriminate retries can lead to latency amplification, resource exhaustion, and cascading failures that can take down entire platforms.

In this article, we will explore the retry pattern in depth, understand when and how to use it safely and effectively.

When Meta announced in Q2 2025 that its new Generative Ads Model (GEM) had driven a 5% increase in ad conversions on Instagram and a 3% increase on Facebook Feed, the numbers might have seemed modest.

However, at Meta’s scale, these percentages translate to billions of dollars in additional revenue and represent a fundamental shift in how AI-powered advertising works.

GEM is the largest foundation model ever built for recommendation systems. It has been trained at the scale typically reserved for large language models like GPT-4 or Claude. Yet here’s the paradox: GEM is so powerful and computationally intensive that Meta can’t actually use it directly to serve ads to users.

Instead, the company developed a teacher-student architecture that lets smaller, faster models benefit from GEM’s intelligence without inheriting its computational cost.

In this article, we look at how the Meta engineering team built GEM and the challenges they overcame.

The Core Problem GEM Solves

Every day, billions of users scroll through Facebook, Instagram, and other Meta platforms, generating trillions of potential ad impression opportunities. Each impression represents a decision point: which ad, from millions of possibilities, should be shown to this specific user at this particular moment? Getting this wrong means wasting advertiser budgets on irrelevant ads and annoying users with content they don’t care about. Getting it right creates value for everyone involved.

Traditional ad recommendation systems struggled with this in several ways. Some systems treated each platform separately, which meant that insights about user behavior on Instagram couldn’t inform predictions on Facebook. This siloed approach missed valuable cross-platform patterns. Other systems tried to treat all platforms identically, ignoring the fact that people interact with Instagram Stories very differently from how they browse Facebook Feed. Neither approach was optimal.

The data complexity also compounds these challenges in the following ways:

Meaningful signals like clicks and conversions are extremely sparse compared to total impression volume.

User features are dynamic and constantly changing.

The system must process multimodal inputs, including text, images, video, and complex behavioral sequences.

Traditional models had severe memory limitations, typically only considering a user’s last 10 to 20 actions.

GEM’s goal was to create a unified intelligence that understands users holistically across Meta’s entire ecosystem, learning from long behavioral histories and complex cross-platform patterns while maintaining the nuance needed to optimize for each specific surface and objective.

How GEM Understands Users?

GEM’s architecture processes user and ad information through three complementary systems, each handling a different aspect of the prediction problem.

The first system handles what Meta calls non-sequence features, which are essentially static attributes and their combinations. These include user demographics like age and location, user interests, ad characteristics like format and creative content, and advertiser objectives.

The challenge here isn’t just knowing these individual features but understanding how they interact. For example, a 25-year-old tech worker has very different purchasing patterns than a 25-year-old teacher, even if they share some interests. The system needs to learn which combinations of features actually matter.

GEM uses an enhanced version of the Wukong architecture with stackable factorization machines that can scale both vertically for deeper interactions and horizontally for broader feature coverage. This architecture works through multiple stacked layers, where each successive layer learns increasingly complex patterns from the simpler patterns discovered by previous layers. For instance, an early layer might discover the basic pattern that young professionals respond well to tech product ads. A layer deeper in the stack builds on this by learning that young professionals in urban areas who show interest in fitness respond especially well to smart wearable ads. An even deeper layer might refine this further, discovering that this combination works best specifically when those ads emphasize data tracking features rather than fashion elements.

The second system handles sequence features, which capture the timeline of user behavior. A user’s actions don’t exist in isolation. They tell a story with order and meaning. Someone who clicked on home workout content, then searched for gyms nearby, then viewed several gym websites, then researched membership costs is clearly on a specific journey. Traditional architectures struggled to process long sequences efficiently because the computational cost grows rapidly with sequence length.

GEM overcomes this with a pyramid-parallel structure. Think of it as processing your behavior history in chunks at the bottom level, then combining those chunks into broader patterns at middle levels, and finally synthesizing everything into a complete journey understanding at the top level. Multiple chunks can be processed simultaneously rather than sequentially, which dramatically improves efficiency.

The breakthrough here is scale. GEM can now analyze thousands of your past actions rather than just the most recent handful. This extended view reveals patterns that shorter windows simply cannot capture, like the progression from casual interest to serious purchase intent that might develop over months.

See the diagram below:

The third system, called InterFormer, handles cross-feature learning by connecting your static profile with your behavioral timeline. This is where GEM’s intelligence really becomes evident. Previous approaches would compress your entire behavior history into a compact summary vector (like reducing an entire novel to a single rating). This compression inevitably loses critical details about your journey.

InterFormer takes a different approach using an interleaving structure. It alternates between layers that focus purely on understanding your behavior sequence and layers that connect those behaviors to your profile attributes.

The first sequence layer might identify that you’ve shown increasing interest in fitness over time.

The first cross-feature layer then considers how your age, income, and location context shape what that fitness interest means.

The second sequence layer re-examines your behavior with these new insights and might notice that your fitness research intensified after a gym opened near your workplace.

The second cross-feature layer then makes even deeper connections about purchase intent and timing.

This alternating process continues through multiple layers, with each cycle refining understanding without losing access to the complete behavioral record.

The Practical Problem with Using GEM

Despite GEM’s obvious strengths, Meta faced a fundamental engineering challenge in using GEM.

GEM is enormous and trained using thousands of GPUs over extended periods. Running GEM directly for every ad prediction would be impossibly slow and expensive. When a user scrolls through Instagram, the system needs to make ad decisions in tens of milliseconds. GEM simply cannot operate at that speed while serving billions of users simultaneously.

Meta’s solution was a teacher-student architecture where GEM acts as the master teacher that trains hundreds of smaller, faster Vertical Models (VMs) that actually serve ads in production. These VMs are specialized for specific contexts like Instagram Stories click prediction or Facebook Feed conversion prediction. Each VM is lightweight enough to make predictions in milliseconds, but they’re much smarter than they would be if trained independently because they learn from GEM.

The knowledge transfer happens through two strategies. Direct transfer works when a VM operates in the same domain where GEM was trained, with similar data and objectives. GEM can teach these models directly. Hierarchical transfer applies when VMs work in specialized areas quite different from GEM’s training domain. In these cases, GEM first teaches medium-sized domain-specific foundation models for areas like Instagram or Facebook Marketplace. These domain models then teach the even smaller VMs. The knowledge flows down through levels, getting adapted and specialized at each stage.

Meta employs three sophisticated techniques to maximize transfer efficiency:

Knowledge distillation with Student Adapter:

Student models learn to replicate GEM’s reasoning process, not just final predictions. The Student Adapter refines GEM’s predictions using recent ground-truth data, adjusting for timing delays and domain-specific differences.

Representation learning:

Creates a shared conceptual framework between teacher and students. GEM learns to encode information in ways that transfer well across different model sizes, adding no computational overhead during ad serving.

Parameter sharing:

This lets VMs selectively incorporate specific components directly from GEM. Small VMs stay fast while borrowing GEM’s sophisticated components for complex user understanding tasks.

Together, these three techniques achieve twice the effectiveness of standard knowledge distillation alone. The continuous improvement cycle works like this:

Users interact with fast VMs in real time

Their engagement data flows back into Meta’s data pipelines

GEM periodically re-trains on this fresh data, updated knowledge transfers to VMs through the post-training techniques, and

Improved VMs get deployed to production.

This cycle repeats continuously, with GEM getting smarter and VMs getting regular intelligence updates.

Training at Unprecedented Scale

Building GEM required Meta to rebuild its training infrastructure from the ground up.

The challenge was training a model at LLM scale, but for the fundamentally different task of recommendation rather than language generation. The company achieved a 23x increase in effective training throughput while using 16x more GPUs and simultaneously improving hardware efficiency by 1.43x.

This required innovations across multiple areas. Multi-dimensional parallelism orchestrates how thousands of GPUs work together, splitting the model’s dense components using techniques like Hybrid Sharded Distributed Parallel while handling sparse components like embedding tables through a combination of data and model parallelism. The goal was to ensure every GPU stayed busy with minimal idle time waiting for communication from other GPUs.

System-level optimizations pushed GPU utilization even higher:

Custom GPU kernels designed for variable-length user sequences, fusing operations to reduce memory bandwidth bottlenecks.

PyTorch 2.0 graph-level compilation automates optimizations like activation checkpointing and operator fusion.

Memory compression, including FP8 quantization to reduce the footprint without impacting accuracy.

NCCLX communication collectives that handle inter-GPU communication without consuming the main compute resources.

The efficiency gains extended beyond raw training speed.

Meta reduced job startup time by 5x through optimizations in trainer initialization, data reader setup, and checkpointing. They cut PyTorch 2.0 compilation time by 7x using intelligent caching strategies. These might seem like minor details, but when you’re training models that cost millions of dollars in compute resources, every percentage point of efficiency improvement matters enormously.

The result is a training system that can iterate rapidly on GEM, incorporating new data and architectural improvements at a pace that would have been impossible with previous infrastructure. This enables Meta to keep GEM at the frontier of recommendation AI while controlling costs enough to make the massive investment worthwhile.

Conclusion

Meta’s roadmap for GEM extends well beyond its current capabilities.

The next major evolution involves true multimodal learning, where GEM processes text, images, audio, and video together rather than treating them as separate input streams. This will enable an even richer understanding of both user preferences and ad creative effectiveness across all content types. The company is also exploring inference-time scaling, which would allow the system to dynamically allocate more computational resources to difficult predictions while handling straightforward cases more efficiently.

Perhaps most ambitiously, Meta envisions a unified engagement model that ranks both organic content and ads using the same underlying intelligence. This would fundamentally change how advertising integrates into social feeds, potentially creating more seamless experiences where ads feel like natural content recommendations rather than interruptions. On the advertiser side, GEM’s intelligence will enable more sophisticated agentic automation, where AI systems can manage and optimize campaigns with minimal human intervention while achieving better results.

Recruiting is a profession that demands both strategic thinking and meticulous attention to detail. Recruiters must make high-value decisions about which candidates are the best fit for a role, but they also spend countless hours on repetitive pattern recognition tasks. Sorting through hundreds of resumes, evaluating qualifications against job requirements, and drafting personalized outreach messages are all essential activities. However, they also consume enormous amounts of time that could otherwise be spent on relationship-building and strategic hiring decisions.

LinkedIn’s Hiring Assistant represents a new approach to solving this challenge.

Rather than replacing recruiters, this AI agent is designed to handle the repetitive, time-consuming aspects of the recruiting workflow, freeing professionals to focus on what they do best: connecting with people and making critical hiring choices.

The most labor-intensive parts of recruiting fall into three main categories.

First, sourcing candidates requires searching through LinkedIn’s network of over 1.2 billion profiles to identify qualified individuals.

Second, evaluating candidates involves carefully reading resumes and profiles to assess whether each person meets the specific requirements of a role.

Third, engaging candidates means drafting and sending personalized communications to potential hires, answering their questions, and maintaining ongoing dialogue throughout the hiring process.

To address these challenges, LinkedIn built the Hiring Assistant with three core capabilities.

The system delivers value at scale by efficiently searching across billions of profiles and handling enterprise-level workloads reliably.

It enables interactive communication by understanding recruiter intent through natural conversation, asking clarifying questions when needed, and adapting its behavior based on real-time feedback.

Lastly, it also features continuous learning by improving over time based on observing what recruiters do, learning individual preferences, and remembering past interactions and decisions.

In this article, we will look at the architecture and technical building blocks of LinkedIn’s Hiring Assistant.

The High-Level Architecture

At its core, the Hiring Assistant is built on what LinkedIn calls a “plan-and-execute” architecture as shown in the diagram below:

To understand why this matters, it helps to know what they avoided. A simpler approach, known as ReAct, would have the AI try to handle everything at once in a single continuous loop. While straightforward, this method runs into problems when tasks get complex. Large language models, the AI systems that power tools like this, can become unreliable when asked to juggle too many things simultaneously.

See the diagram below for the ReAct pattern

.Instead, LinkedIn split the work into two distinct phases:

The Planner acts as the strategic thinker. When a recruiter makes a request, the Planner examines it from a high level, breaks the work into smaller, manageable steps, and creates a structured plan for what needs to happen. Think of it as a project manager outlining the approach before any actual work begins.

The Executor then takes over. It works through the plan step by step, using available tools to complete each task. For each step, the Executor runs its own loop of reasoning and action, figuring out what needs to happen and then making it happen.

This divide-and-conquer strategy brings several advantages:

First, it makes the system more reliable. Breaking complex recruiting workflows into discrete steps means the AI is less likely to get confused or make mistakes.

Second, it allows for better cost management. LinkedIn can use more powerful AI models for complex reasoning tasks while deploying simpler, cheaper models for straightforward steps.

Third, tasks are far more likely to be completed successfully when they are well-defined and manageable in scope.

Beyond the plan-and-execute design, the Hiring Assistant uses a message-driven architecture.

Each recruiter gets their own individual instance of the assistant, complete with its own identity and mailbox. Everything works through asynchronous messages, much like email. When a recruiter asks the assistant to find candidates, they do not have to sit and wait for results. The assistant receives the message, processes it in the background, and sends updates when ready.

This asynchronous approach is what enables the assistant to work at scale. While a recruiter focuses on other tasks, their assistant can be searching through millions of profiles, evaluating candidates, and preparing recommendations, all without requiring constant attention or supervision.

The Agentic User Experience

The Hiring Assistant operates in two complementary modes, each designed for different stages of the recruiting process:

Interactive Mode:

When recruiters first start a new project, they work with the assistant in interactive mode. This feels like having a conversation with a colleague. Recruiters can clarify what kind of person they are looking for, refine job requirements, and get immediate feedback on their requests. The assistant shows its reasoning as it works, making the process transparent. This builds trust because recruiters can see exactly what the system is doing and correct course quickly if something seems off.

Asynchronous Mode:

Once the recruiter and assistant are aligned on what success looks like, the system shifts into asynchronous mode. This is where the real power of automation comes into play. The assistant works autonomously in the background, running large-scale searches across millions of profiles, continuously updating candidate pipelines, and evaluating new applicants as they appear.

LinkedIn describes this as a “source while you sleep” capability.

The assistant can review thousands of candidates overnight, a task that would take a human recruiter weeks to complete manually.

Yet even in this autonomous mode, humans remain in control of important decisions. The assistant surfaces candidates and provides recommendations, but recruiters make the final calls about who to contact and ultimately hire. This balance between automation and human judgment is central to how the system is designed.

Technical Building Blocks

The Hiring Assistant is built on top of LinkedIn’s broader agent platform, a foundation of reusable components that can power any AI agent product across the company. This approach means the LinkedIn engineering team does not have to reinvent the wheel each time it builds a new intelligent system.

At the user-facing level, a client-side SDK embeds the assistant directly into recruiter workflows. This SDK creates dynamic interfaces that adapt based on what the AI needs at any given moment. It supports multiple input methods, including chat, voice, and typing assistance, while logging all interactions for future analysis and improvement.

Connecting this interface to backend services is a GraphQL API, which delivers data in structured packages called view models. These contain everything needed to display information on screen. LinkedIn calls it the agent-driven UI, where the AI itself can determine what recruiters see, dynamically adjusting the interface as tasks progress.

Rather than the traditional request-response pattern where you ask a question and wait for an answer, the system uses a push-based, event-driven architecture. It works as follows:

The user interface subscribes to updates from the agent, and when something changes, the agent publishes that update. This means the interface refreshes automatically without users needing to manually reload anything.

Long-running AI tasks are delivered through streaming responses. Instead of waiting for a complete answer, recruiters see the AI’s reasoning unfold in real time, with results appearing as soon as they become available.

If a recruiter is logged in on multiple devices, cross-session synchronization keeps everything in sync. An action taken on a phone immediately reflects on a desktop browser.

The Supervisor Agent

At the center of the Hiring Assistant sits what LinkedIn calls the supervisor agent. If the overall system is a team, the supervisor is the team leader who makes sure everyone works together effectively.

See the diagram below:

The supervisor handles several critical responsibilities:

It oversees workflow management for the entire hiring process, ensuring tasks move forward in the right sequence.

When a recruiter sends a message or request, the supervisor receives it and routes it to the appropriate sub-agent for handling.

It also makes judgment calls about task prioritization, deciding what requires human input versus what can be safely automated.

Beyond just delegating work, the supervisor coordinates between different sub-agents to ensure they work together smoothly. It actively observes the environment, watching for changes like new candidate activity or application submissions, and triggers appropriate actions in response.

The supervisor also manages the human-in-the-loop aspect of the system. It knows which decisions are significant enough to require human approval and surfaces those moments to recruiters.

All communication, whether from users or between sub-agents, flows through the supervisor. It serves as the central hub that keeps the entire operation organized and aligned with recruiter goals.

The Specialized Sub-Agents

The Hiring Assistant divides recruiting work among several specialized sub-agents, each focused on a specific part of the workflow. This modular design allows each component to excel at its particular task while working together as a cohesive system. Let’s look at the various sub-agents in detail:

Intake Agent

The intake agent serves as the starting point for every hiring project.

It gathers job requirements from recruiters, confirming essential details like job title, location, and seniority level. When information is missing, the agent leverages LinkedIn’s Economic Graph (a digital map of the global economy) to intelligently fill in gaps. The agent then generates specific qualifications based on successful past hires and industry knowledge, creating a clear framework for evaluating candidates.

Sourcing Agent

Finding the right candidates is perhaps the most knowledge-intensive part of recruiting, and the sourcing agent approaches this challenge with multiple strategies.

It creates search queries using traditional Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT operators), generates AI-powered queries based on hiring requirements, and draws on historical recruiter search patterns as starting points. Importantly, customer data never crosses company boundaries, maintaining strict data isolation.

What sets this agent apart is its integration with LinkedIn’s Economic Graph.

This gives it access to insights about top locations, job titles, and skills for specific talent pools. It can identify which candidates are actively looking or were recently hired, understand talent flow patterns between companies and industries, spot fast-growing companies and skill sets, flag companies experiencing layoffs, and highlight opportunities at top schools or companies with open positions. These insights help the agent find hidden gems that might otherwise be overlooked, going well beyond simple keyword matching.

The sourcing agent also implements a closed feedback loop. It combines sourcing with evaluation results, using AI reasoning to refine queries based on which candidates prove to be good matches. This allows the system to balance precision (finding exactly the right candidates) with liquidity (finding enough candidates), continuously improving the quality and volume of results over time.

Evaluation Agent

Reading resumes and assessing qualifications is one of the most time-consuming tasks for recruiters.

The evaluation agent tackles this by reading candidate profiles and resumes, comparing them against job qualifications, and providing structured recommendations backed by evidence. It shows why a candidate may or may not match requirements, rather than simply offering a yes or no answer.

LinkedIn engineered this agent to address several complex challenges.

Before any evaluation begins, recruiters must review and approve the qualifications being used.

Safety checks ensure these qualifications follow responsible AI policies. The agent searches through profiles and resumes for specific evidence demonstrating how candidates meet each qualification, surfacing this evidence to recruiters for review.

To ensure accuracy, LinkedIn built quality benchmarks for testing the evaluation agent across different scenarios.

They developed custom AI models specifically optimized for qualification evaluation, as general-purpose models could not achieve the necessary combination of accuracy and speed. Using techniques like speculative decoding and custom serving infrastructure, these fine-tuned models can evaluate candidates in seconds rather than minutes, fast enough to support real-time, conversational refinement of requirements.

Candidate Outreach Agent

Once promising candidates are identified, the outreach agent handles communication.

It writes personalized messages, sends initial outreach and follow-ups, and replies to candidate questions using job-specific FAQs defined during intake. The agent can even schedule phone screenings directly through messaging, streamlining coordination.

Candidate Screening Agent

Supporting the interview process, the screening agent prepares tailored interview questions based on hiring requirements and candidate profiles.

It can transcribe and summarize screening conversations while capturing notes and insights. Importantly, recruiters maintain full control, able to take over conversations at any time or guide the process as needed.

Learning Agent

The learning agent enables the system to improve over time.

It analyzes recruiter actions such as which candidates they message or add to pipelines, learning from both explicit feedback and implicit behavioral signals. The agent updates job qualifications based on these patterns, but any suggested changes must be reviewed and approved by recruiters before being applied. This ensures the assistant adapts while keeping humans in control.

Cognitive Memory Agent

Finally, the cognitive memory agent gives the assistant persistent memory across interactions.

It remembers past conversations, preferences, and decisions, helping personalize recommendations over time. All memory data remains scoped to the individual recruiter’s environment with strong privacy protections.

This data is never used to train AI models, ensuring customer information stays secure and confidential.

The Quality Pillars

Building an AI agent that operates at scale requires a comprehensive approach to quality that ensures the system behaves safely, responsibly, and effectively.

The LinkedIn engineering team built its quality framework on two complementary pillars:

1 - The Rails

Product policy serves as the rails that keep the system on track. These policies set clear boundaries for safety, compliance, and legal standards while defining expected agent behavior. They establish minimum quality thresholds that must be met.

To enforce these standards, LinkedIn employs AI-powered judges that evaluate different aspects of quality. Some judges check for coherence, asking whether outputs make logical sense. Others verify factual accuracy, ensuring the system does not generate false or misleading information.

2 - The Compass

Human alignment acts as the compass, ensuring the assistant moves toward genuinely valuable outcomes.

This pillar is grounded in human-validated data, including annotated datasets where people label examples, and real recruiter activity. When a recruiter messages a candidate or adds them to a pipeline, the system treats this as a strong positive signal.

Over time, the assistant learns to recommend candidates matching these recruiter-validated patterns. Human alignment also serves to validate whether product policies are actually working in practice.

Conclusion

LinkedIn’s Hiring Assistant demonstrates a big approach to building enterprise-grade AI agents.

By adopting a plan-and-execute architecture, the system breaks complex recruiting workflows into manageable steps, improving reliability and reducing errors. The message-driven design allows each recruiter to have their own assistant instance that works asynchronously in the background, enabling true scale.

The division of labor among specialized sub-agents ensures that each component can focus on what it does best, from sourcing and evaluation to outreach and screening. Integration with LinkedIn’s Economic Graph provides market intelligence that goes beyond simple keyword matching, helping uncover candidates who might otherwise be overlooked.

Perhaps most importantly, the system balances automation with human judgment. The quality framework keeps the assistant safe and aligned with real hiring outcomes, while the learning agent ensures continuous improvement based on individual recruiter preferences.

Most companies get stuck tinkering with prompts and wonder why their agents fail to deliver dependable results.

Go beyond the prompt: get the guide.

When we first interact with large language models, the experience is straightforward. We type a prompt, the model generates a response, and the interaction ends.

This single-turn approach works well for simple questions or basic content generation, but it quickly reveals its limitations when we tackle more complex tasks. Imagine asking an AI to analyze market trends, create a comprehensive report, and provide actionable recommendations. A single response, no matter how well-crafted, often falls short because it lacks the opportunity to gather additional information, reflect on its reasoning, or refine its output based on feedback.

This is where agentic workflows come into play.

Rather than treating AI interactions as one-and-done transactions, agentic workflows introduce iterative processes, tool integration, and structured problem-solving approaches. These workflows transform language models from sophisticated text generators into capable agents that can break down complex problems, adapt their strategies, and produce higher-quality results. The difference is similar to comparing a quick sketch to a carefully refined painting. Both have their place, but when quality and reliability matter, the iterative approach wins.

In this article, we will look at the most popular agentic workflow patterns and how they work.

Understanding Agentic Workflows

An agentic workflow doesn’t just respond to a single instruction. Instead, it operates with a degree of autonomy, making decisions about how to approach a task, what steps to take, and how to adapt based on what it discovers along the way. This represents a fundamental shift in how we think about using AI systems.

Consider the difference between asking a basic chatbot and an agentic system to help write a research report. The basic chatbot receives our request and generates a report based on its training data, delivering whatever it produces in one response. An agentic system, however, might first search the web for current information on the topic, then organize the findings into themes, draft sections of the report, review each section for accuracy and coherence, revise weak areas, and finally compile everything into a polished document. Each of these steps might involve multiple sub-steps, decisions about which tools to use, and adaptations based on what the agent discovers.

What makes workflows truly agentic are the iteration and feedback loops built into the process. Instead of generating output in a single pass, agentic workflows involve cycles where the agent takes an action, observes the result, and uses that observation to inform the next action. This mirrors how humans actually solve complex problems. We rarely figure everything out up front and execute a perfect plan. Instead, we try something, see what happens, learn from the result, and adjust our approach. Agentic workflows bring this same adaptive, iterative quality to AI systems.

The Five Essential Agentic Workflow Patterns

Let us now look at five essential agentic workflow patterns:

Reflection Pattern: The Self-Improving Agent

At its core, reflection is about having an agent review and critique its own work, then revise based on that critique. This simple idea improves output quality because it introduces an iterative refinement process that catches errors, identifies weaknesses, and enhances strengths.

Here’s how the reflection cycle works in practice.

The agent first generates an initial output based on the task or prompt it receives.

Then, instead of immediately presenting this output as final, the agent switches into critique mode. It examines what it just produced, looking for problems, inconsistencies, areas that lack clarity, or opportunities for improvement. This critique becomes the basis for revision.

The agent generates an improved version that addresses the issues it identified. Depending on the implementation, this cycle might repeat multiple times, with each iteration refining the output further.

See the diagram below:

The power of reflection becomes even more apparent when we specialize in the type of critique being performed. Some examples are as follows:

An agent might reflect specifically on accuracy, checking whether the facts and claims it made are correct and well-supported.

Alternatively, reflection might focus on clarity, asking whether someone unfamiliar with the topic would understand the explanation.

For creative writing, reflection might evaluate tone, ensuring the voice matches the intended style and audience.

For code generation, reflection could focus on identifying bugs, security vulnerabilities, or opportunities to optimize performance.

The reflection pattern works best for tasks where quality matters more than speed and where there are subjective aspects that benefit from review. The pattern, however, is less necessary for simple, factual queries where the answer is straightforward or for tasks where speed is paramount and good enough is truly sufficient.

Tool Use Pattern

The tool use pattern represents a fundamental expansion of what AI agents can accomplish.

A language model by itself, no matter how sophisticated, is limited to reasoning about information it learned during training and generating text based on that knowledge. It cannot access current information, perform precise calculations with large numbers, retrieve data from specific databases, or interact with external systems. Tools change everything.

In the tool use pattern, agents are equipped with a set of capabilities they can invoke when needed. These might include web search engines for finding current information, APIs for accessing services like weather data or stock prices, code interpreters for running programs and performing calculations, database query tools for retrieving specific records, file system access for reading and writing documents, and countless other specialized functions. The critical distinction from traditional software is that the agent itself decides when and how to use these tools based on the task at hand.

See the diagram below:

When an agent receives a task, it analyzes what capabilities are needed to accomplish that task. For example:

If the task requires information the agent doesn’t have, it recognizes the need for a search or data retrieval tool.

If the task involves mathematical operations, it accesses a calculator or code interpreter.

If the task requires interacting with a specific service, it uses the appropriate API tool.

What makes tool use powerful is the dynamic nature of tool selection and the ability to chain multiple tool calls together.

The agent doesn’t follow a predetermined script. If the first search doesn’t return adequate information, the agent might reformulate its query and search again. If an API call fails or returns an error, the agent might try an alternative approach or a different tool entirely. This adaptability makes tool-enabled agents far more capable than rigid automated workflows.

Reason and Act Pattern (ReAct)

The Reason and Act pattern, commonly known as ReAct, represents a sophisticated approach to problem-solving that combines explicit reasoning with iterative action. Rather than thinking through an entire plan before acting, or blindly taking actions without reflection, ReAct agents alternate between reasoning about what to do next and actually doing it. This interleaving of thought and action creates a natural, adaptive problem-solving process.

The ReAct cycle follows a clear pattern.

First, the agent reasons about the current situation and what it needs to accomplish. This reasoning step is made explicit, often literally written out as the agent’s internal thought process. The agent might think about what information it has, what it still needs, what approaches might work, and what the best next step is.

Then, based on this reasoning, the agent takes an action. This might be using a tool to gather information, performing a calculation, or making a decision.

After the action, the agent observes the results and enters a new reasoning phase, thinking about what it learned and what to do next. This cycle continues until the agent determines it has accomplished the goal or reached a point where it cannot proceed further.

See the diagram below:

The explicit reasoning steps serve multiple important purposes.

First, they help the agent stay on track and maintain focus on the goal. By articulating what it’s trying to accomplish and why each action makes sense, the agent is less likely to go down irrelevant paths or get stuck in unproductive loops.

Second, reasoning steps enable adaptation. When an action doesn’t yield expected results, the reasoning phase allows the agent to diagnose why and adjust its approach rather than blindly continuing.

Third, the reasoning trail provides transparency. Users and developers can see not just what the agent did, but why it made those choices, which is valuable for trust, debugging, and understanding the agent’s decision-making process.

Comparing ReAct to pure planning or pure execution highlights its strengths.

Pure planning means figuring out all the steps before taking any action. This works well when we have complete information, and the environment is predictable, but it struggles when we need to discover information along the way or when circumstances change.

Pure execution means taking actions without much forethought, which is fast but often inefficient and prone to mistakes.

ReAct finds a middle ground, providing enough structure through reasoning while maintaining flexibility through iterative action.

Planning Pattern

The planning pattern takes a different approach from ReAct by emphasizing upfront strategic thinking before execution begins.

When using the planning pattern, the agent starts by analyzing the overall goal and understanding what success looks like. It then breaks down this goal into smaller, more manageable subtasks. This decomposition continues until the agent has identified concrete, actionable steps.

Crucially, the agent identifies dependencies between tasks, determining which steps must be completed before others can begin and which steps can potentially happen in parallel. The agent also considers what resources, tools, or information each step will require. Only after creating this structured plan does the agent begin execution.

See the diagram below:

One of the planning pattern’s key strengths is adaptive planning.

The planning pattern works best for tasks with natural phases or stages where some activities logically precede others. It’s valuable for tasks with constraints like deadlines, budgets, or resource limitations where coordination matters. It shines in situations where mistakes or backtracking would be costly, making it worth investing time in thoughtful planning. Complex projects involving multiple work streams benefit greatly from planning.

However, the planning pattern has limitations.

For simple, linear tasks where each step naturally suggests the next one, the overhead of creating a formal plan provides little benefit.

For highly uncertain tasks where we’re likely to discover critical information during execution that fundamentally changes the approach, extensive upfront planning might be wasted effort.

Multi-Agent Pattern

The multi-agent pattern represents perhaps the most sophisticated approach to building AI systems.

Instead of relying on a single agent to handle everything, this pattern uses multiple specialized agents that collaborate to accomplish tasks. Each agent has specific expertise, capabilities, or perspectives, and they work together much like human teams do.

The core insight behind multi-agent systems is that specialization often leads to better performance than generalization.

A single agent trying to be excellent at everything faces challenges. It must balance competing requirements in its design and training. It needs broad knowledge but also deep expertise. It must be creative but also critical. By dividing responsibilities among multiple agents, each can be optimized for its specific role.

In a multi-agent system, we typically see several types of roles.

There are specialist agents focused on particular domains or tasks, such as a research agent that excels at finding and synthesizing information, a coding agent optimized for writing and debugging code, or a data analysis agent skilled at statistical analysis and visualization.

There are often critics or review agents whose job is to evaluate outputs from other agents, identifying flaws, suggesting improvements, or verifying quality.

There’s usually a coordinator or orchestrator agent that manages the overall workflow, deciding which specialist should handle each subtask and ensuring all the pieces come together coherently.

The multi-agent pattern introduces complexity trade-offs as follows:

Coordination overhead increases with more agents.

Communication between agents requires clear protocols.

Debugging becomes more challenging because problems might arise from interactions between agents rather than individual agent errors.

The benefits must justify these costs. For simple tasks, a single capable agent is almost always better. For complex tasks requiring diverse expertise, careful coordination, or multiple perspectives, the multi-agent approach often produces superior results despite its added complexity.

Conclusion

The various agentic workflow patterns represent a fundamental evolution in how we build and deploy AI systems.

Moving beyond simple prompting to sophisticated, iterative processes has transformed what AI agents can reliably accomplish. Here’s a quick summary of the patterns we have covered:

The reflection pattern ensures quality through self-improvement.

Tool use extends capabilities far beyond pure language generation.

ReAct combines thoughtful reasoning with adaptive action.

Planning brings strategic thinking to complex tasks.

Multi-agent collaboration leverages specialization and diverse perspectives.

Together, these patterns provide a robust toolkit for building AI systems capable of handling real-world complexity.

What makes these patterns particularly powerful is that they’re not mutually exclusive. The most sophisticated agent systems often combine multiple patterns to achieve their goals.

Substack

In November 2024, Anthropic launched the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to fix this problem. This wasn’t just another developer tool. It aimed to tackle a key infrastructure issue in AI engineering.

The challenge?

Every AI application needs to connect to data sources. Until now, they had to build custom integrations from scratch. This approach creates a fragmented ecosystem that does not scale.

For example, the world isn’t frozen in time, but LLMs are…

If you want an AI to “monitor server logs,” you can’t feed it a file. You would have to build a data pipeline that polls an API every few seconds. Filter out noise, then push only the relevant anomalies into the AI’s context window

4

. If the API changes its rate limits or response format, your entire agent breaks.

A better way to think of MCP is like a USB-C port.

The Old Way (Before USB):

If you bought a mouse, it had a PS/2 plug. A printer had a massive parallel port. A camera had a proprietary cable. If you wanted to connect these to a computer, the computer needed a specific physical port for each one.

This is the “N×M” problem:

Each device maker had to figure out how to connect to each computer. So, computer makers had to create ports for every device.

The MCP Way (With USB-C):

Now, everything uses a standard port.

Computer (AI Model

5

) needs one USB-C port. It doesn’t need to know if you are plugging in a hard drive or a microphone; it just speaks “USB.”

Device (Data Source) requires a USB-C port. It doesn’t need to know if it’s plugged into a Mac, a PC, or an iPad.

The result: you can plug anything into anything instantly.

The analogy makes sense in theory. But to understand why MCP matters, you need to see how painful the current reality actually is…

The Integration Complexity Problem

Every AI assistant needs context to be useful:

Claude

6

needs access to your codebase. ChatGPT may require your Google Drive files. Custom agents need database connections. But how do these AI systems actually get that context?

Traditionally, each connection requires a custom integration.

If you’re building an AI coding assistant, you need to:

Write code to connect to the GitHub API.

Add authentication and security.

Create a way to change GitHub’s data format into a version that your AI can understand.

Handle rate limiting, errors, and edge cases.

Repeat this entire process for GitLab, Bitbucket, and every other source control system.

This creates the N×M problem:

‘N’ AI assistants multiplied by ‘M’ data sources equals N×M unique integrations that need to be built and maintained.

When Cursor wants to add Notion support, they build it from scratch. When GitHub Copilot wants the same thing, they build it again. The engineering effort gets duplicated across every AI platform.

The traditional approaches have fundamental limitations:

Static, build-time integration

:

Integrations are hard-coded into applications. You can’t add a new data source without updating the application itself. This makes rapid experimentation impossible and forces users to wait for official support.

Application-specific security implementations

:

Every integration reinvents authentication, authorization, and data protection. This leads to inconsistent security models and increases the attack surface.

No standard way to discover

:

AI systems can’t find out what capabilities a data source has. Everything needs clear programming. This makes it hard to create agents that adapt. They can’t use the new tools on their own.

The result is a ‘broken’ ecosystem!

Innovation is stuck because of integration work. Users can access only the connections that application developers create. So that’s a mess.

Now let’s look at how MCP cleans it up…

How MCP Solves It

MCP’s solution is straightforward:

define a single protocol that functions across all systems.

Instead of building N×M integrations, you build N clients (one per AI application) and M servers (one per data source). The total integration work drops from N×M to N+M.

When a new AI assistant

7

wants to support all existing data sources, it just needs to implement the MCP client protocol once.

When a new data source wants to be available to all AI assistants, it just needs to implement the MCP server protocol once.

Two critical architectural features power this efficiency:

1. Dynamic Capability Discovery

In traditional integrations, the AI application

8

must know the data source details in advance.

If the API changes, the application breaks…

MCP flips this. It uses a “handshake” model. When an AI connects to an MCP server, it asks,

“What can you do?”

.

The server returns a list of available resources and tools in real time.

RESULT:

You can add a new tool to your database server, like a “Refund User” function. The AI agent finds it right away the next time it connects. You won’t need to change any code in the AI application.

2. Decoupling Intelligence from Data

MCP separates the thinking system (AI model) from the knowing system (the data source).

For Data Teams:

They can build robust, secure MCP servers for their internal APIs without worrying about which AI model will use them.

For AI Teams:

They can swap models without having to rebuild their data integrations.

This decoupling means your infrastructure doesn’t become obsolete whenever a new AI model gets released.

You build your data layer once, and it works with whatever intelligence layer you choose to plug into it.

An AI agent using MCP doesn’t need to know in advance what tools are available. It simply connects, negotiates capabilities, and uses them as needed. This enables a level of flexibility and scale that is impossible with traditional static integrations.

The high-level concept is straightforward.

But the real elegance is in how the architecture actually works under the hood…

MCP Architecture Deep Dive

MCP’s architecture has three main layers.

These layers separate concerns and allow for easy scalability:

The Three-Layer Model

Hosts

are user-facing apps.

This includes the Claude Desktop app, IDEs like VSCode, or custom AI agents you create. Hosts are where users connect with the AI. They are also where requests begin. They do more than display the UI; they orchestrate the entire user experience.

The host application interprets the user’s prompt.

It decides whether external data or tools are needed to fulfill the request. If access is necessary, the host creates and manages several internal clients. It keeps one client for each MCP server it connects to.

The protocol layer handles the mechanics of data access.

Clients

are protocol-speaking connection managers that run on hosts.

Each client maintains a dedicated 1:1 connection with a single MCP server. They serve as the translation layer.

They convert abstract AI requests from the host into clear MCP messages. These messages, like tools/call or resources/read, can be understood by the server. Clients do more than send messages. They manage the entire session lifecycle. This includes handling connection drops, reconnections, and state.

When a connection starts, the client takes charge of capability negotiation. It asks the server which tools, resources, and prompts it supports.

Servers

provide context.

They act as the layer that connects real-world systems, such as PostgreSQL databases, GitHub repositories, or Slack workspaces.

A server connects the MCP protocol to the data source. It translates MCP requests into the system’s native operations. For example, it turns an MCP read request into a SQL

SELECT

query. They are very flexible. They can run on a user’s machine for private access or remotely as a cloud service.

Servers share their available capabilities when connected. They inform the client about the Resources, Prompts, and Tools they offer.

Core Primitives

MCP defines three fundamental primitives that servers can expose:

1 Resources

They’re context-controlled by applications. They provide data that the AI can read but not change.

Resources might be:

Database query results.

Files from a file system.

API responses from a web service.

Documentation or knowledge base articles.

2 Prompts

They’re reusable instruction templates with variables. Think of them as parametrised prompts that can be shared across applications.

Users and applications can invoke prompts with different values for code and focus areas. Prompts help standardize common AI workflows.

Plus, they make it easy to share effective prompting techniques.

as a guest author.

Scaling

Our single chat server design works great for 1000 users. But it’s terrible for a billion.

So let’s scale horizontally...

Problem: Users on Different Servers

User A connects to Server 1. User B connects to Server 2.

So how does a message from User A reach B?

Option 1: Load balancer does nothing

This approach doesn’t work. Server 1 receives the message but has no connection to User B.

Option 2: Kafka topics per user

Create a Kafka topic (a category or feed name to which messages are published) for each user. Servers subscribe to topics for their connected users.

Why this approach won’t work?

Kafka needs about 50KB of overhead per topic.

1 billion users = 50 TB just for topic metadata.

Kafka wasn’t built for billions of topics. It’s designed for thousands of high-throughput topics, not billions of low-throughput ones.

Option 3: Consistent hashing

Hash user IDs to specific servers

2

.

Always route the same user to the same server. When a message arrives for User B, forward it directly to Server 2.

Pros:

Direct server-to-server communication,

No extra infrastructure.

Cons:

All-to-all connections between servers (if you have 1000 servers, each needs connections to 999 others).

Adding new servers requires careful coordination to avoid dropping messages during the transition.

Servers need to be big to keep the fleet small.

Option 4: Redis Pub/Sub (what we actually use)

This is the cleanest solution at our scale.

How it works:

Redis Pub/Sub

3

is a lightweight messaging system built into Redis. It lets servers subscribe to channels and publish messages to those channels. Think of it like a radio station (channel) where servers can tune in to listen and broadcast messages.

When User B connects to Chat Server 2, Server 2 subscribes to Redis channel of user:B.

When Server 1 needs to deliver a message to User B, Server 1 publishes the message to Redis channel user:B.

Redis routes it to Server 2. Then Server 2 delivers to User B via WebSocket

4

.

Why we chose this:

Redis Pub/Sub uses only a few bytes per channel (versus Kafka’s 50KB per topic).

It’s “at most once” delivery, meaning if no one’s listening when you publish, the message is lost. But that’s fine for our use case. We already have durability through the Message Queue

5

and database. Pub/Sub is just for real-time delivery to online users. If they’re offline, they still get messages from their inbox.

The beauty is that chat servers don’t need to know about each other. They talk only to Redis. Add or remove chat servers at will. No coordination needed.

Tradeoffs:

Redis Pub/Sub adds a few milliseconds of latency (single-digit, usually under 5ms) because messages bounce through Redis.

But this is negligible compared to network latency.

We also need to run a Redis cluster for high availability, which adds operational complexity. Yet the simplicity of not managing server-to-server connections makes it worth it.

Message Storage Service: The Detailed Flow

The Message Storage Service sits between Message Queue and Database.

Let’s break down exactly what it does…

Architecture:

→ Message Queue (Kafka)

→ Message Storage Service instances

→ Database Cluster

Each instance:

Consumes from assigned Kafka partitions

Batches writes for efficiency

Handles retries and failures

Updates indexes

Detailed Processing Flow:

Step 1: Consuming from Queue

Storage Service Instance:

Subscribes to Kafka partitions 0-9 (out of 100 total)

Polls for new messages every 100ms

Receives a batch of 500 messages

Processes batch in parallel (thread pool of 20 workers)

Step 2: Message Validation and Enrichment

For each message:

Validate schema (required fields present)

Check message size limits (text < 4KB, no huge strings)

Enrich with metadata:

Calculate message hash (for deduplication)

Extract mentions (

@username

patterns)

Identify links for preview generation

Classify content type

Generate indexes needed for queries

Step 3: Batch Writing

Instead of writing messages one-by-one:

Accumulate messages in the memory buffer

When buffer hits 1000 messages OR 5 seconds elapsed:

Sort messages by target shard

Group messages by conversation

Prepare batch

INSERT

statements

3. Write the entire batch in one operation per shard

Why batching matters:

A single database INSERT takes ~5ms.

1000 individual INSERTs = 5 seconds.

One batched INSERT of 1000 messages = 50ms.

That’s a 100x throughput improvement.

Step 4: Writing to Database (Cassandra)

For each shard:

Cassandra processes this batch atomically. All succeed, or all fail.

Step 5: Updating Indexes

Simultaneously with message write:

Update conversation index:

Latest message timestamp

Unread count

Last message preview

Update search index (if full-text search enabled):

Extract keywords

Send to Elasticsearch cluster

Update analytics:

Increment counters (messages/day, active users)

Send to analytics pipeline (separate Kafka topic)

Step 6: Handling Failures

If write fails:

Log error with message details

Check error type:

Temporary (connection timeout): Retry with exponential backoff

6

Permanent (validation error): Move to dead-letter

7

queue for investigation

Duplicate key: Skip (already written, this is retry)

Don’t block other messages

Update monitoring metrics

Step 7: Committing Offset

After a successful write:

Commit Kafka offset (mark messages as processed)

This ensures we don’t reprocess on restart

If service crashes before commit:

On restart, reprocess from last committed offset

Duplicates handled by checking

message_id

Scaling the Storage Service:

Each instance is stateless. To handle more throughput:

Add more instances (they auto-distribute Kafka partitions)

Each instance processes independently

No coordination needed between instances

Kafka handles partition assignment

If you have 10 instances and add an 11th, Kafka automatically rebalances. Some instances give up partitions to the new instance. Within seconds, the load is redistributed.

Monitoring Critical Metrics:

Consumer lag: How many messages behind are we?

(Alert if lag > 10,000 messages)

Write latency: How long does each batch take?

(Alert if p99 > 500ms)

Error rate: How many failures?

(Alert if > 0.1%)

Throughput: Messages per second processed

(Scale up if maxed out)

Tradeoffs:

Message Storage Service adds latency (messages sit in the queue before being written).

But it decouples chat servers from database performance. Chat servers can acknowledge messages immediately without waiting for database writes.

This keeps user-facing latency low even if the database is temporarily slow.

End-to-End Encryption and Key Management

WhatsApp’s defining feature is end-to-end encryption.

Messages are encrypted on the sender’s device and only decrypted on the recipient’s device. Even WhatsApp’s servers can’t read the content.

The challenge is how to encrypt messages when users might have multiple devices, be offline, or need to verify identities?

Signal Protocol (What WhatsApp Uses):

WhatsApp implements the Signal Protocol, which provides:

End-to-end encryption

Forward secrecy

8

(compromising one message doesn’t compromise others)

Future secrecy (compromising a key doesn’t compromise future messages)

Key Exchange Flow:

When User A first messages User B:

Identity Keys (long-term):

Each user generates an identity key pair on registration

Public key gets uploaded to server

Private key never leaves device

Prekeys (medium-term):

User B generates 100 signed prekeys

Uploads to server

Server stores them for future initiators

One-time Prekeys:

User B generates additional one-time prekeys

Used once and discarded

Provides forward secrecy

Session Establishment:

User A fetches User B’s public identity key and a prekey from server

User A generates ephemeral key pair

Performs Diffie-Hellman key exchange

Derives shared secret (session key)

Encrypts message with session key

Sends encrypted message + A’s ephemeral public key

User B receives:

Uses their private keys + A’s ephemeral public key

Derives the same session key

Decrypts message

Establishes bidirectional encrypted session

Message Encryption:

Each message is encrypted with:

Encrypted Message = AES-256(message, session_key + message_counter)

MAC = HMAC-SHA256(encrypted_message, mac_key)

The

message_counter

prevents replay attacks. Each message increments the counter.

Ratcheting (Forward Secrecy):

After each message, keys are “ratcheted” forward:

New ephemeral key pair generated

New session key derived

Previous keys discarded

This means compromising today’s key doesn’t reveal:

Yesterday’s messages,

Or tomorrow’s messages.

Multi-Device Support:

User A has a phone and a laptop.

How does encryption work?

Approach 1: Sender Keys (Groups):

For groups, sending individual encrypted copies to each device is expensive.

Instead:

User A generates a sender key for the group

Encrypts sender key for each member using their session key

Distributes sender key

All future messages get encrypted with sender key

Much more efficient for large groups

Approach 2: Session Per Device (1:1):

For 1:1 chats.

Each device has its own identity

User A’s phone and laptop are separate entities

When messaging User B, send two encrypted copies (one for each of B’s devices)

Tradeoffs:

End-to-end encryption adds complexity.

Can’t search messages server-side

Can’t provide message previews in push notifications

9

(would require server decryption)

Server can’t filter spam/abuse (content is opaque)

Multi-device sync is harder

But the privacy benefits are worth it. Users trust WhatsApp because messages are truly private.

Key components of an exchange

are

:

Broker - allows people to buy and sell stocks on the exchange.

Gateway - entry point for brokers to send BUY or SELL orders to the exchange.

Matching Engine - matches BUY and SELL orders to create trades.

Order Processing Workflow:

User creates a BUY or SELL order through the broker.

Gateway validates the order: authentication, check request format & rate limiting.

Then it forwards the request to the order manager. It performs risk checks using rules defined in the Risk Manager.

Risk manager verifies whether the user’s wallet has sufficient funds. Plus, it freezes the required amount in the wallet to prevent double-spending.

Order Manager sends the request to the Matching Engine.

Matching Engine keeps an in-memory “order book” for each stock. It matches BUY and SELL orders based on price and time priority.

After a match occurs, the Matching Engine creates two executions (fills). One for the buyer. One for the seller.

Matching Engine distributes trade results as market data to clients through the Gateway. It uses UDP multicast

1

for efficiency.

Most steps “before and after” matching run in parallel to BOOST throughput.

⭐ STAR THE REPO

FIX Protocol

Broker send orders to the gateway using the Financial Information eXchange (

FIX

) protocol (for institutional clients).

FIX is a text-based protocol. Although reliable, it’s slow because text parsing consumes CPU. Gateway uses a FIX engine to receive and send FIX messages.

You can build your own engine for ultra-low latency, or buy a pre-optimized commercial one.

Exchange streams market data using FIX Adapted for STreaming

2

(

FAST

).

It’s much faster because it’s a binary, compressed version of FIX... binary encoding is compact and easy for CPUs to parse.

Many exchanges provide even faster binary protocols for high-frequency trading:

Integrated Trade Capture Handler (

ITCH

) - a fast market data feed

Order Unified Communication Handler (

OUCH

) - a fast order entry protocol

These avoid text parsing and are specifically designed for low-latency trading.

Let’s keep going!

Gateway

It accepts connections from brokers and supports REST + WebSocket APIs

3

(for retail traders).

Gateway could use Nginx server for HTTPS termination and WebSocket routing. Plus, exchange could run many gateway servers in parallel behind a load balancer for high availability.

Gateway:

Tracks sequence numbers of each client,

Normalize and validate incoming messages,

Protects matching engine from malformed or abusive client traffic,

Uses TCP backpressure

4

to slow down misbehaving or overloaded clients automatically,

Allows only ONE outstanding order per client to maintain strict, deterministic ordering.

Exchanges used to have MANY gateways (some faster, some slower).

But traders exploited this by:

Flooding slower gateways with junk orders to delay competitors,

Routing orders only through the fastest gateway (unfair advantage).

So modern exchanges use a SINGLE gateway for

all clients of the “same class”

.

This means all clients in the same class (institutional clients, retail traders) have identical latency

5

. Thus ensuring fairness and reducing system load.

Here’s how Gateway handles concurrency:

Inbound (broker → gateway):

Assigns one thread per TCP connection

Parses messages and publishes them to a Disruptor ring buffer

Disruptor efficiently distributes events to internal services (order manager, risk checks,...)

Outbound (matching engine → broker):

Outbound events come through the ring buffer

Ring buffer dispatches events to subscribed services

Each session has its own outbound handler thread

If a client is slow, backpressure (ring buffer fills up) prevents system slowdowns

NOTE: Inbound and outbound paths share no mutable state.

Wallet

A wallet stores a user’s funds & assets for trading.

But there’s a risk of DOUBLE SPENDING if two orders from the same user arrive at once… and both threads try to read the “same” balance.

Example:

Thread A reads balance X and subtracts Y

Thread B reads balance X and subtracts Z

Here are three ways to prevent this problem:

1 Mutex Locks

Only one thread updates the user’s balance at a time. This is safe, but it significantly slows down the system.

2 ConcurrentHashMaps

They allow fast (parallel) reads/writes if keys fall into different segments. Yet it doesn’t protect the correctness of multi-step operations (

read → modify → write

).

3 Database Row-Level Locking

Exchanges rely on SQL databases (like MySQL InnoDB) because they:

Support ACID (safe transactions)

Provide row-level locking, so two threads cannot update the same user’s balance at once

Plus, this approach makes the

read → modify → write

operations safer.

Sample Database Schema

user_account (user_id, balance)

wallet (user_id, symbol, quantity)

stock (symbol, price)

Tables can be sharded by

“user_id”

for performance.

Data Structures

account balance -

HashMap {user_id: balance}

stock price -

HashMap {symbol: price}

Ready for the next technique?

Disruptor Pattern

Disruptor is a concurrency model that doesn’t use locks.

It’s built as a ring buffer (fixed-size circular array with up to 20 million slots).

Imagine the ring buffer as:

“super-fast, in-memory queue for passing events between threads.”

Producers write events; consumers read them in order.

Each thread maintains its own sequence number, so there is no locking, blocking, or contention.

A disruptor offers:

high throughput,

microsecond-level latency.

It’s excellent for workloads where many components must process the same event.

Here’s WHERE the stock exchange uses the disruptor:

1 Gateway

Gateway publishes incoming orders to an input disruptor.

It allows many tasks to run in parallel (without blocking each other), such as:

journaling to disk

unmarshalling (parsing messages)

assigning global sequence numbers

replicating events to standby engines

Each step is independent; disruptor provides high throughput without locks.

2 Order Manager

Order manager uses disruptors to broadcast events to various internal consumers, such as:

risk checks

routing logic

audit/journal writers

user balance service

sequence enforcement

Each consumer reads using its own sequence counter,,, so they never block each other.

3 Market Data

Output disruptors take results and prepare them for network output:

execution reports

market data updates

client notifications via gateway

Each topic (e.g., trades, market data) gets its own disruptor to avoid interference.

Designing a real-time chat application like WhatsApp is one of the most common system design interview questions.

In a short period, you need to show that you understand not just the happy path, but also all the things that can go wrong when messages fly between disconnected users on mobile networks.

WhatsApp handles over 100 billion messages daily for 2+ billion users.

We’ll build this from scratch, starting with a simple version that works for a few thousand users, then scale it up to handle billions of users sending messages across unreliable mobile networks.

This is a practical guide:

We won’t hand-wave away the hard parts or pretend everything works. Instead, we’ll build something functional, identify where it breaks, and fix it properly.

What we’ll cover in Part 1:

Requirements and capacity estimation

Core architecture and data models

Why WebSockets beat other protocols for real-time messaging

Service discovery and presence management

Handling online and offline message delivery

Multi-device synchronization

Media file uploads without killing your servers

By the end, you’ll understand not just what to build, but why each decision is made and what breaks when you get it wrong.

His approach focuses on what top employers actually care about: system design expertise, advanced project experience, and elite-level interview performance.

Requirements: What Are We Actually Building?

Starting simple… we’re designing a real-time messaging app that lets people send text messages and media to each other. But let’s get specific about what “real-time” actually means here.

Core requirements:

Users can send and receive text messages in 1:1 chats

Group chats with up to 100 participants (we’ll see why this number matters later)

Messages delivered while users are offline get queued up for 30 days

Media attachments (images, videos, audio clips)

Message status tracking (sent, delivered, read)

Online/offline status with

“last seen”

Non-functional requirements:

Low latency delivery (under 500ms when users are online)

Guaranteed message delivery (messages can’t just disappear)

Handle billions of users with high throughput

Don’t store messages on servers longer than necessary

Stay resilient when individual components fail

The tricky bit most people miss is the offline requirement.

It’s easy to design for everyone to be online. But real life doesn’t work that way…

Back-of-the-Envelope: Understanding the Scale

Let’s run the numbers so we don't build something that collapses under real load.

User metrics:

1 billion registered users

500 million daily active users

50 million concurrent connections during peak hours

Average 10-20 messages per user daily

Message estimations:

Daily messages: 500M users × 20 messages = 10 billion messages/day

That’s roughly 115,000 messages per second on average.

But during peak hours, we need to multiply that by 3-5x. So we’re looking at 350,000-500,000 messages per second.

Storage calculation:

Each message with metadata averages about 1KB (text content, sender/receiver IDs, timestamp, status flags, etc.)

Daily storage: 1KB × 10B messages = 10 TB/day

Annual storage: 3.6 PB/year

But here’s the thing:

Most messages get delivered and cleared from the server within seconds. We’re not storing everything forever. Users download messages to their devices, and we clean them up on the server.

Factor in the 30-day retention for undelivered messages and 10% of users keeping history on servers. And suddenly we’re looking at 400-500 TB of active storage instead of petabytes.

Bandwidth:

50M concurrent connections at peak.

If each connection averages 10KB/s for active messaging, that’s 500 GB/s of bandwidth. This is why WhatsApp was famous for running on minimal infrastructure.

They are very efficient in not sending unnecessary data.

High-Level System Design

Let’s build this in stages, starting simple and adding complexity only when we need it:

The Basic Components

Mobile App (Client)

The user’s phone. It maintains a persistent connection to our backend, handles the UI, manages local message storage, and retries failed operations.

Load Balancer

This sits in front of our chat servers and distributes incoming connections across multiple servers.

Think of it as a traffic cop routing cars to different lanes. It routes incoming WebSocket connections to chat servers and uses sticky sessions (meaning once you connect to Server A, you stay on Server A). Simply put, users don’t bounce between servers mid-conversation.

It also monitors server health and stops sending traffic to dead servers.

Chat Servers

Chat servers maintain WebSocket connections to clients (a persistent two-way communication channel that stays open), route messages between users, track who’s online, and handle message persistence.

Each server can handle hundreds of thousands of simultaneous connections.

Message Queue

This decouples message writing from delivery.

When a chat server receives a message, it immediately acknowledges receipt to the sender, then asynchronously pushes it to the queue for storage and delivery.

We can use tools like

Kafka

or

RabbitMQ

that work well here.

Message Storage Service

Consumes from the queue and writes messages to the database.

It also handles querying message history and managing retention policies (such as deleting old messages after 30 days).

Message Database

Persistent storage for messages.

NoSQL works well here (

Cassandra

,

DynamoDB

) because we need high write throughput and our query patterns are straightforward (fetch messages by user/conversation/timestamp).

We’re writing billions of messages per day, so we need something that can handle massive write volume without slowing down.

User Connection Cache

In-memory store (

Redis

) tracks which users are online, which chat server they’re connected to, and their last activity timestamp.

This makes routing decisions fast. Checking Redis takes microseconds, whereas querying a database takes milliseconds. At scale, that difference matters.

Blob Storage + CDN

Blob storage (e.g.,

AWS S3

or

Google Cloud Storage

) stores media files; it holds the actual files.

CDN (Content Delivery Network) caches popular files at edge locations worldwide so downloads are fast regardless of where users are. It offers direct upload/download paths so chat servers don’t become bottlenecks for large file transfers.

Notification Service

Handles push notifications for offline users through APNs (Apple Push Notification Service for iOS) and FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging for Android).

When someone messages you while you’re offline, this makes your phone buzz.

Presence Service

Dedicated service for managing online/offline status. Receives heartbeats from users, updates Redis, and publishes presence changes to interested subscribers.

The WebSocket Decision

Most messaging systems use WebSockets.

Let’s understand why by looking at what doesn’t work:

Polling

The client asks,

“Any new messages?”

every few seconds.

This wastes bandwidth and adds latency.

If you’re checking every 2 seconds and a message arrives right after you check, you wait 2 seconds to see it. Multiply that by millions of users constantly asking for updates even when there’s nothing new, and you’re burning resources for no reason.

Long polling

Client opens a request, server holds it open until there’s a message or a timeout.

Long polling is better than regular polling.

But it’s still problematic:

You’re constantly opening and closing connections. Each message requires a full HTTP handshake (the back-and-forth to establish a connection).

At scale, this overhead kills you. Your servers spend more time managing connection lifecycles than actually delivering messages. Plus, idle HTTP connections still consume server resources (memory for connection state, thread pool slots) without the efficiency benefits of WebSockets.

WebSockets (WHAT WE USE)

One persistent bidirectional connection that stays open. Both the client and the server can push data at any time. Minimal overhead once established.

Why we chose WebSocket:

The connection remains open throughout the session. When User A sends a message to User B, it flows through A’s WebSocket connection to the server, which pushes it through B’s WebSocket connection instantly.

No polling and no repeated handshakes. Just data flowing both ways. The connection overhead happens only once when you open the app; everything after that is just message content.

WebSocket Tradeoffs:

It requires special load balancers that support them (Layer 4 load balancing instead of Layer 7).

They also use more memory per connection on the server since you’re keeping connections open.

But for real-time messaging, the latency and bandwidth benefits make it worthwhile.

Handling Idle WebSocket Connections:

What happens when a user opens WhatsApp but doesn’t send any messages for hours?

The connection stays open but idle!

We handle this with heartbeats: Client sends a lightweight ping every 30 seconds. Server responds with Pong.

If the server doesn’t receive a heartbeat for 60 seconds, it assumes the connection died (network issue, app backgrounded) and closes it. This prevents the accumulation of zombie connections that waste server resources.

Idle connections still consume memory (connection state, socket buffers), but the cost is minimal compared to the benefit of instant message delivery when the user sends something.

Identifying Servers That Don’t Stand Still

In production, chat servers come and go… they crash, get deployed, scale up and down. So how does the system keep track of what’s available?

The Problem:

Your load balancer needs to know which chat servers are healthy.

Chat servers need to know which other services are available (Message Storage Service instances, Redis cluster nodes). Hardcoding IPs doesn’t work when instances are ephemeral.

Solution: Service Registry Pattern

We use a service registry such as

Consul

or

AWS Cloud Map

.

Here’s how it works:

Registration:

When the Chat Server starts:

Server boots up on IP

10.0.1.45:8080

Registers itself with Consul:

Service name:

“chat-server”

Instance ID:

“chat-server-abc123”

Health check endpoint:

“/health”

Metadata:

{region: “us-east”, capacity: 100000}

3. Sends a heartbeat every 10 seconds

4. If the heartbeat stops, Consul marks it unhealthy after 30 seconds

Discovery:

When the Load Balancer needs available servers:

Query Consul:

“Give me all healthy chat-server instances”

Consul returns list:

[10.0.1.45:8080, 10.0.1.67:8080, ...]

Load balancer updates the routing table

Watches for changes (Consul notifies on updates)

Why we chose this:

Services discover each other dynamically.

Deploy new servers; they auto-register.

Kill a server, and it’s automatically removed.

No manual configuration updates.

Health Checks:

Consul hits this endpoint every 10 seconds.

If the instance fails three times in a row, it is marked unhealthy.

Tradeoffs:

Service discovery adds another system to maintain (Consul cluster needs to be highly available).

But the alternative is manual instance management, which doesn’t scale and causes outages when you forget to update configurations.

Data Models

Let’s design tables that actually support our use cases:

Users Table (SQL -

PostgreSQL

works)

Messages Table (NoSQL - Cassandra)

Groups Table (SQL)

User Connection Registry (Redis)

Message Inbox (Redis)

WebSocket and REST API Schemas

Now let’s get concrete with actual message formats:

Distributed systems aren’t just a concept; they’re the invisible machinery holding our digital world together.

Every time you send a message, book a taxi, or stream a song, dozens of nodes across the world work together to make it look simple. But simplicity on the surface hides chaos underneath.

We’ll see how these systems serve millions globally while maintaining control over the chaos.

But first, let’s understand why we need distributed systems…

I want to introduce

Sahil Sarwar

as a guest author.

He’s a software engineer at

Confluent

, passionate about distributed systems, system internals, and the philosophy behind designing large-scale systems.

Substack

LinkedIn

Connect with him if you’re interested in deep dives into distributed systems, infrastructure, and the mindset behind technical design.

Why Distributed Systems?

Traditionally, software systems ran on a single machine.

But as the internet became popular, we realized a single machine might be insufficient at scale. That’s how the idea of vertical and horizontal scaling came in…

1 Vertical Scaling

A simple way to scale is by adding:

more CPU,

more memory,

faster processors.

However, it’s impossible to scale vertically forever because of hardware limitations & cost effectiveness.

2 Horizontal Scaling

Instead of relying on one powerful server,

“What if many small servers shared the work?”

And those servers coordinate to act as one unit. That’s the key idea behind a DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM.

What are Distributed Systems?

When you hear “distributed systems”, you might think of buzzwords like clusters, microservices, or Kubernetes…

But the core idea is actually simple:

A distributed system is a group of independent servers that work together and appear to the user as one system.

Each server has its own CPU, memory, and processes.

They communicate over a network to achieve one shared goal. There’s no shared RAM, no shared global clock, and no single machine that “knows everything.”

These features define distributed systems:

No Shared Memory

Each node works independently and can’t directly read another machine’s variables.

All communication happens through messages sent over the network.

We need idempotency

1

, retry logic, and consensus algorithms

2

to maintain system correctness even when messages are lost or fail.

No Global Clock

There is no universal time across machines.

Clocks drift, and network delays make timing unpredictable.

This makes it difficult to determine the exact order in which events occurred.

To solve this, we use

logical time

:

Lamport Clocks

If timestamp

a

is less than

b

, then event

a

happened before event

b

in logical order.

Vector Clocks

Extend Lamport clocks by tracking event counts from every node, allowing systems to detect concurrency and understand ordering across many processes.

Message Communication

Nodes communicate using protocols such as

gRPC

3

,

HTTP

4

,

Kafka events

5

, and so on.

Messages may not arrive, may arrive late, may be duplicated, or may even arrive out of order.

A distributed system stays correct not because communication is perfect, but because it handles failures gracefully.

Let’s keep going…

Distributed Systems in Real Life

Distributed systems aren’t just theory - they’re everywhere, and in everything that we use:

Google Search

: a massive network of crawlers, indexers, and ranking nodes running across many data centers.

Netflix

: region-wide services for streaming, recommendations, authentication, video transcoding, and content delivery.

DynamoDB & Cassandra

: distributed key–value stores that replicate data across nodes for availability and scale.

Kafka

: distributed, fault-tolerant event log for asynchronous communication.

Stripe

: event-driven architectures built on reliable messaging and idempotent operations.

Distributed vs Decentralized vs Parallel Systems

These three terms sound similar, but they describe different designs…

1 Distributed Systems

A distributed system is a group of independent nodes that work together to present themselves as a single, logical system.

Examples:

Google Spanner

(globally distributed database)

Apache Kafka

(distributed log system)

There is often a “leader or a control plane” responsible for managing consistency, replication, and communication between nodes.

2 Decentralized Systems

A decentralized system removes or minimizes the need for a single point of control.

Examples:

Bitcoin and Ethereum (blockchain networks)

BitTorrent (peer-to-peer file sharing)

Each node operates more autonomously, and coordination occurs through peer-to-peer consensus, not central orchestration.

3 Parallel Systems

They run multiple computations simultaneously, but on a single machine or a tightly coupled cluster with shared memory.

They typically have:

One global clock,

A shared memory space.

Examples:

GPU workloads

Multithreaded programs

High-performance computing clusters

TL;DR

Distributed systems: loosely coupled, message-passing, reliability-oriented

Decentralized systems: trustless, peer-based, no central authority

Parallel systems: tightly coupled, shared memory, performance-oriented

If many machines need to work together, they must communicate and share state efficiently.

The next question then is:

“How do machines communicate effectively at scale?”

Communication in Distributed Systems

When machines communicate in a distributed system, all interactions occur over a network. And networks come with their own set of messy realities.

Onward.

1 Network Realities

By default, the network is unreliable… Messages can:

Be lost: never reach the destination

Be duplicated: delivered more than once

Be corrupted: bits flipped during transit

Arrive out of order: later messages come before earlier ones

Experience latency: unpredictable delays

Designing a distributed system is really about expecting the WORST and still making the system work.

As Murphy’s law states:

“If something can go wrong, it will go wrong.”

2 TCP: Reliability Layer

Distributed systems rely heavily on TCP

6

because it provides:

Reliable delivery: data gets delivered reliably, or the sender is notified of failure

Ordering: packets arrive in the order they were sent

Error checking: corrupted packets are detected and retransmitted

TCP establishes this connection via a 3-way handshake:

SYN: Client says,

“I want to connect.”

SYN-ACK: Server replies,

“Got it, ready to proceed.”

ACK: Client confirms,

“Great, let’s begin.”

3 TLS: Security Layer

You can consider TCP as a “mailman” and TLS

7

as the envelope with a lock and signature. TLS ensures:

Encryption

8

: nobody can read the data

Authentication: you know who you’re talking to

Integrity: messages can’t be altered without detection

During the TLS handshake, both sides:

Choose cipher suites

Agree on the TLS version

Verify the server’s TLS certificate

Generate session keys for encrypted communication

Reliability loses its meaning if someone can intercept or tamper with the data. In modern systems, every RPC and network call should use TLS.

If servers spread worldwide, how do they find each other?

4 DNS: Finding the Right Node

That’s where DNS (Domain Name System) comes in:

It resolves human-readable names to IP addresses.

And acts as a basic service discovery

9

mechanism.

In large distributed systems, DNS is usually layered with service registries or load balancers. But at the core, you always need a way to translate a name into a network endpoint.

Communication alone is not enough… For a distributed system to function as a single, coherent system, the nodes must also coordinate their actions.

And that brings us to the next major challenge: coordination.

Coordination Challenges in Distributed Systems

Once machines start working together, they need to stay in sync. Yet coordinating many nodes creates new problems.

Let’s look at the key challenges:

1 Failure Detection

Determining whether a machine has failed may seem simple… but it’s not.

“If a node doesn’t respond, is it dead, or just slow?”

Distributed systems usually detect failures using these two ways:

Heartbeat mechanism

Heartbeat messages are small signals that nodes send to each other to show they are still alive.

These messages serve as health checks, enabling each node to determine whether its peers are functioning properly or have failed.

Gossip protocol

Each node regularly sends a small “I am alive” message to others.

System considers the node dead if these messages stop for too long.

Like real gossip, nodes share what they know with others.

These techniques help to detect failures in a noisy, unreliable network.

But you’ve got to find a balance between speed and accuracy:

Check often → false positives (you think a node failed when it hasn’t)

Check slowly → system reacts late to real failures

If machines are spread around the world, it becomes hard to know which event happened first between two different servers.

So let’s read the solution to this problem:

2 Event Ordering and Timing

If we use

time.Now()

to decide “which event happened when,” we run into issues:

Each machine has its own local clock… and these clocks can drift

10

.

Because of this, it is almost impossible to keep all clocks perfectly in sync across many machines.

In distributed systems, we rarely care about the exact timestamp. What we really need to know is which event happened first.

To solve this, we use algorithms called “logical clocks”.

Lamport Clocks

Lamport clocks use a simple counter on each machine:

Each process starts with a counter at 0

For every local event, increase the counter:

LC = LC + 1

When sending a message, attach the current counter value

When receiving a message, update the counter to:

LC = max(local LC, received LC) + 1

Example:

Consider two machines - M1 and M2.

M1 sends a message with

LC = 5

M2 receives it when its own clock is

LC = 3

So M2 updates its clock to

max(3, 5) + 1 = 6

From the above interactions:

Send event has LC = 5

Receive event has LC = 6

This keeps the correct order

11

: send < receive.

It tells you what happened before what… but not if two events were independent… so it cannot detect concurrency.

Let’s understand why:

M1 has

LC = 5

and does event A →

LC(A) = 6

M2 has

LC = 2

and does event B →

LC(B) = 3

These two events are independent; there is no communication between the machines.

But Lamport clocks say

3 < 6

, so it looks like B happened before A, even though they were concurrent. So Lamport clocks only show ordering, not concurrency.

Vector clocks fix this problem!

Vector Clocks

They extend the idea on which Lamport’s clocks are based:

“What if every machine knows every other machine’s order?”

If there are N machines, the vector keeps N entries, and each entry tracks that machine’s event count, M[i].

This means:

Every event carries a snapshot of what that machine knows about others’ state.

When a machine receives a message, it merges the knowledge using element-wise maximum.

This gives each machine a partial history of the entire system.

With vector clocks, a system can tell:

Which event happened first,

Whether two events happened at the same time (concurrently).

In a distributed system, we need a single source of truth for all operations… so it helps to have one machine act as the leader.

Let’s dive in!

3 Leader Election

The leader becomes the source of truth, and the other machines (followers) replicate its state.

But if all servers share the same design, how can we determine which server qualifies to become the “leader”?

Algorithms like Raft

12

solve this in a clean and predictable way:

All nodes start as followers.

If no leader is found, the followers enter a candidate state to become the leader.

Voting occurs, and the node that gets the most votes becomes the leader.

Once elected, the leader coordinates updates, and followers replicate its log.

Raft is popular because it’s simple, has well-defined states (follower, candidate, leader), and provides strong safety guarantees. It’s used in many distributed databases and consensus systems.

4 Data Replication and Consistency

Maintaining data consistency across many machines is one of the most challenging problems in distributed systems.

Because data is stored on different nodes, every write must be replicated to other nodes to ensure consistency.

But not all systems need the same level of strictness… different consistency models exist depending on what the application needs:

Linearizability

Every operation looks instant and globally ordered.

Readers always see the latest write.

This is the strictest model and is expensive at scale because every operation requires coordination across machines.

Plus, it often adds latency.

Sequential Consistency

Each node’s operations appear in order, but different nodes may see different global orders.

It's easier to achieve than linearizability.

Writes can be done locally first and then replicated asynchronously to others.

Eventual Consistency

If no new writes occur, all replicas will eventually converge on the same value.

Used in high-availability systems like DynamoDB and Cassandra.

You trade immediate correctness for higher availability and better partition tolerance.

CAP Theorem

These consistency choices connect directly to the CAP theorem, which says a distributed system can only provide two out of three at the same time:

Consistency (C): Every read returns the latest write (or an error).

Availability (A): Every request gets a response (even if it’s outdated).

Partition Tolerance (P): The system keeps working even if the network breaks into parts.

So why not all three?

Network partitions (P) are common in distributed systems. When they occur, the system must choose between:

Consistency (C): Stop serving outdated data until the partition heals.

Availability (A): Serve whatever data is available, even if outdated.

Thus, a system can be CP, AP, or CA, but never all three at the same time. (There is always a tradeoff.)

Next, we look at scalability techniques… the reason distributed systems exist in the first place: to handle more load than a single machine ever could.

This is Part 2 of how a stock exchange works.

Let’s start with a

TL;DR of

Part 1

!

Three key components of an exchange are:

Broker - allows people to buy and sell stocks on the exchange.

Gateway - entry point for brokers to send BUY or SELL orders to the exchange.

Matching Engine - a component that matches BUY and SELL orders to create trades.

A stock market reduces latency by avoiding unnecessary services in the critical path.

BUT… threads have to pass events efficiently to achieve “ultra-low” latency at scale.

Examples:

New order event,

Risk check event,

Cancel order event,

Trade execution event,

Market data update event,

Replication or Journal event.

So the

concurrency model

matters!

👉 Explore EverMemOS

Most system design goo-roos think using locks, or queues, or message brokers is enough.

They’re WRONG…

Here’s why:

1 Locking

There are two key locking models:

Pessimistic,

Optimistic.

Pessimistic locking

A thread acquires a lock before touching shared data. So other threads must wait until the lock gets released. This means only one thread can update the shared data at a time.

But on a stock exchange:

Many threads try to read or update the same data at scale.

And locks force them to wait in line, which causes latency spikes.

More threads → more blocking → much SLOWER.

Even a single lock can slow down a thread by 10x, and with many threads, performance could drop 100x.

Besides, there’s also a risk of deadlock

1

if two threads wait on each other.

So this approach wouldn’t work for a stock exchange.

Optimistic locking

It doesn’t use traditional locks; instead, it uses compare-and-swap (

CAS

) to detect conflicts.

Here’s how:

A thread reads shared data + its version.

Then it writes new data only if the original version hasn’t changed in the meantime.

If another thread updates it first, the write fails, and the thread has to RETRY.

This technique works well when conflicts are rare,,, but on a stock exchange:

Many threads try to change hot data (sequence counters, and so on).

Thus CAS failures become more frequent, and spin + retry loops waste CPU.

So performance weakens at scale.

2 Traditional Queues (ArrayBlockingQueue)

A Queue has:

Head (where consumers read from)

Tail (where producers write to)

Yet when there are many threads at once:

Consumers compete to update the head,

Producers compete to update the tail.

This creates contention and forces locking or other synchronization techniques… which slows everything down.

Plus, head, tail, and size variables are often on the same CPU cache line

2

.

NOTE: A CPU reads and writes memory in chunks (usually 64 bytes) called

cache lines

, not single variables.

So there’s a risk of

false sharing

3

when:

Two threads update different variables

And those variables live on the same cache line

Even though the threads aren’t sharing data (i.e., no locks), the hardware thinks they’re, causing:

massive slowdowns

constant cache invalidations

This is a performance problem for traditional queues under high concurrency.

Also, a queue is often:

Full (because producers are fast)

Or empty (because consumers are fast)

So producers/consumers constantly fight over the same memory region. And this causes contention.

Besides, in some implementations, reads may require writes when consumed. This also causes contention.

3 Message Brokers

Message brokers like Kafka and RabbitMQ are built for general messaging... NOT for microsecond latency.

They introduce extra overhead because of:

serialization,

buffering,

network hops.

Plus, their queues use locks and background threads, which add jitter.

So they’re too slow for a stock exchange!

Traditional system design interviews tend to focus on backend architecture:

API servers, databases, caching layers, load balancers, and service-oriented designs.

“Front-end” system design, by contrast, deals with the problems of scale and complexity that manifest in the browser or client environment.

Instead of optimizing for query latency or data replication, the focus shifts to rendering efficiency, client structure, network utilization, and managing data consistency between the client and server.

System design interviews matter because they reveal how well an engineer can think beyond individual components and consider the entire user experience as a system. Front-end system design interviews are a relatively new but increasingly important part of the hiring process for front-end engineers. They test not only one’s technical ability to build user interfaces but also the architectural thinking required to scale those interfaces to millions of users.

For companies with complex, dynamic interfaces such as Twitter/X, Netflix, Airbnb, Google Docs, and Figma, the frontend client is no longer a thin layer that merely renders data. It is a distributed system in its own right, managing state, orchestrating data fetching, caching results, handling concurrency, and maintaining real-time synchronization with the backend.

Designing this layer effectively can have a dramatic impact on user engagement and perceived performance, ultimately driving business goals.

Front-end system design is therefore not merely about choosing frameworks or UI libraries. It is about building systems that can evolve, scale, and deliver consistent performance as features grow and teams expand. Understanding this distinction is essential before diving into the architecture of complex interfaces like the Twitter/X timeline, where milliseconds of latency and subtle interaction patterns can define the entire product experience.

Types of questions in front-end system design interviews

Front-end system design interviews fall into two categories:

“application design and component design.”

While both draw on the same foundation of architectural thinking, they operate at different levels of abstraction and test different problem-solving instincts.

The

application-level design

focuses on how to structure and architect an entire product or large feature. Candidates might be asked to design something like the Twitter timeline, a media streaming website, or a collaborative document editor.

These questions assess a candidate’s ability to design systems that can handle complex data flows, synchronize with back-end services, manage client-side state, and maintain consistent performance as the application scales.

Strong answers demonstrate an understanding of how to divide an application into layers, manage global versus local state, handle rendering efficiently, and make trade-offs between client-side and server-side responsibilities.

Each kind of app brings unique challenges that candidates should spend most of their time discussing:

Social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter)

: Timeline API, pagination, rendering posts in various formats, performance

E-commerce & travel booking (e.g., Amazon, Airbnb)

: SEO, performance, forms, localization

Media streaming (e.g., Netflix, YouTube)

: Media streaming protocols, media player implementations

Collaborative apps (e.g., Google Docs, Google Sheets)

: Real-time collaboration models, conflict resolution approaches

The

component-level design

narrows the focus to building a single, self-contained piece of UI that appears simple on the surface but hides significant complexity beneath. Common examples include designing an autocomplete input, image carousels, or a modal dialog.

These components must handle accessibility, keyboard navigation, focus management, animations, and edge cases such as async data fetching and nested interactions.

Interviewers use these problems to evaluate a candidate’s depth of understanding in UI behavior, browser APIs, rendering models, and user experience details.

Although these two categories differ in scope, they complement each other…

Application-level design tests a candidate’s ability to think in systems and to understand how data and state flow through a complex interface.

Component-level design tests a candidate’s ability to execute on the smallest building blocks of those systems with precision and craft.

Together, they form a complete picture of what it means to design and engineer modern front-end applications at scale.

Framework for approaching front-end system design interviews

Many engineers struggle with system design interviews because they approach problems reactively, jumping straight into technical details before establishing a clear structure, or simply just hopping around topics with no clear flow, and risk ending up not sufficiently covering the important areas of the question.

I know it all too well because that was how I failed my first few system design interviews.

Therefore, I came up with an easy-to-remember mnemonic,

RADIO,

to help me remember how to approach system design questions.

The

RADIO framework

offers a systematic way to think through design questions methodically. It ensures you start with clarity, communicate your reasoning, and cover both breadth and depth.

RADIO

stands for:

Requirements

,

Architecture

,

Data model

,

Interface

,

Optimizations

.

Let’s dive in!

Requirements

Begin by clarifying what problem you are solving and what success looks like.

Identify both functional and non-functional requirements, what the system must do, and how well it must perform. This is also where you scope the problem to fit the interview.

For example, when asked to design the Twitter timeline, you might clarify whether the focus is on rendering the feed, handling infinite scroll, or supporting real-time updates.

Architecture

Once the goals are clear, outline the high-level structure of the system and describe its responsibilities.

In front-end design interviews, it’s common to have the layers for data fetching, state management, and the view (what users see and interact with). You should explain how data flows through these layers, where caching happens, and how user actions propagate changes.

The goal is to show that you can decompose a complex UI into well-defined subsystems that interact cohesively.

Data model

Describe the main data entities and state in the system.

With Twitter, that would be the feed, tweets, composer message, etc., and how they relate to one another. A solid understanding of data modeling shows you can design efficient structures for rendering what the user needs to see and interact with.

Interface (API)

Define how different parts of the system communicate.

This includes both internal interfaces, such as component boundaries and state management APIs, and external interfaces, such as REST or GraphQL endpoints. Each API should consist of the intention, parameters, and response shape.

Optimizations

After establishing a functional design, discuss the aspects of the system that are unique or complex and how you would improve it for scale and performance.

This can include performance techniques like DOM virtualization

1

, lazy loading

2

, media optimizations, and more.

RADIO Framework

Use the

RADIO framework

as a guide to ensure a comprehensive answer… not strict linear steps.

Lead the discussion with requirements, then be flexible to dive wherever the conversation or technical complexity requires.

Architecture, Data model, and the Interface (API) are usually discussed as a whole and not strictly in order.

Some candidates prefer to design the data model first before the Architecture and API, which might make more sense depending on the question.

Lastly, end with optimizations and deep dives, but revisit any of the earlier areas if you’re discussing new requirements or extending to new features.

Design Twitter/X Timeline’s frontend

Let’s apply the RADIO framework to a common front-end system design question:

“Design Twitter/X Timeline.”

By the end of this newsletter, we will have a solid front-end design for implementing a Twitter timeline, including specific optimizations for each part.

From here on, we’ll refer to the product as “Twitter” rather than “X”, since “Twitter” is more readable and recognizable.

Requirements

Let’s define some core functional requirements of the Twitter timeline:

Users can browse a timeline UI containing a list of tweets

Timeline contains text and image-based tweets

Users can perform actions on tweets, such as liking and retweeting

Users can click on a tweet to view the replies

When users scroll to the bottom of the timeline, more tweets load

Users can create new tweets

In reality, Twitter’s timeline supports more formats, such as videos, polls, and other actions, like replying to tweets.

But let’s first focus on the core functionality: consuming timeline tweets and creating new tweets.

Besides functional requirements, we can also discuss how to improve non-functional aspects such as performance, user experience, and accessibility through optimizations and deep dives.

Architecture

A well-structured front-end architecture separates concerns across distinct layers, each responsible for a specific set of tasks.

Before we discuss the layers involved, we have two decisions to make:

(1) where to render the webpage (client vs. server vs. hybrid),

(2) how navigations occur (the traditional way of full-page reloads vs. client-side).

Rendering approach

A large-scale application like Twitter can be built using several rendering approaches, each offering different trade-offs among performance, complexity, and infrastructure costs.

The main models are:

server-side rendering (SSR),

client-side rendering (CSR),

hybrid model.

Server-side rendering (SSR)

SSR generates the full HTML for a page on the server before sending it to the client.

This leads to faster first-paint times and better SEO because users and crawlers receive meaningful content immediately. Once the HTML is loaded, the client “hydrates” the page to attach event listeners and to enable interactivity.

Modern websites rely heavily on SSR to ensure quick perceived performance.

Client-side rendering (CSR)

In this model, the server first delivers a minimal HTML shell and a JavaScript bundle.

The browser then executes the JavaScript to fetch data and render the UI. CSR offers great interactivity once loaded, since subsequent updates can happen entirely on the client without page reloads.

However, it has slower first load performance and weaker SEO, since users initially see a blank page/spinner until the data is fetched.

Hybrid rendering

Hybrid architectures combine SSR and CSR to get the best of both worlds.

The server renders the initial page load for speed and SEO, and the client handles dynamic updates. This is often implemented using frameworks like Next.js and Remix. Twitter could render the first batch of tweets server-side and then fetch and render new tweets client-side as the user scrolls.

Since timelines are highly personalized, rendering timelines on the server primarily benefits performance instead of SEO. In reality, Twitter likely uses CSR because SSR requires more infrastructure resources, and fetching a timeline on Twitter is already pretty quick (takes less than 1s); the benefits SSR brings don’t outweigh the complexity required.

In practice, frameworks like

Next.js

,

React Router

, and

Tanstack Start

help you implement these various rendering patterns in your app, even allowing for custom rendering per page.

Navigation approach

Website navigation follows either a single-page application or a multi-page application approach… and the choice has direct implications for user experience and performance.

A

single-page application (SPA)

is a web app that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates its content as the user interacts with the app, without requiring a full page reload. This works by using JavaScript to modify the page URL, fetch data from the server, and update the DOM. This results in fast, seamless navigation and an app-like experience.

In

multi-page applications (MPA)

, each route corresponds to a separate HTML page. Navigating between pages triggers a full-page reload, which can simplify server-side rendering and improve SEO. Content-heavy sites typically use MPAs, but they can feel slower and less fluid for highly interactive features.

For a social media app like Twitter, SPAs are preferred, and SPAs rely on CSR.

More importantly, pages in SPAs can benefit from data in a shared client store. Most users access a tweet from the timeline. In an SPA, the key details of the tweet (text, media) are already loaded on the page and stored in the store; navigation to the tweet details page is instant and requires no server-side interaction. Additional data, such as replies, is fetched after navigation occurs.

On the other hand, in an MPA, navigation blows away the current page state. Hence, users will experience longer delays when navigating between pages, as they have to wait for the server to finish generating the HTML.

Architecture layers

With rendering and navigation decided, we can define the layers of the Twitter front end, which can be broken down into four main layers:

View

,

Store

,

Data access

, and the

Server

.

View

The view layer is what users interact with directly.

It includes the timeline page, tweet detail page, and a tweet composer component. It’s responsible for rendering data from the store and triggering user actions, such as liking a tweet or composing a new one. Its main goal is to provide a fast, interactive, and accessible user experience while remaining declarative and predictable in how it reacts to data changes.

In practice, these are your JavaScript frameworks/libraries, such as

React

,

Vue

,

Svelte

, etc.

Store layer

The store acts as the source of truth for client-side data and state.

It holds all application state in memory: the timeline, tweets, users, composer message, etc. And ensures consistency across different parts of the interface.

When a user performs an action, such as liking a tweet, the store immediately updates the local state (often optimistically) before synchronizing with the server. It also caches data for quick retrieval, normalizes

3

entities to prevent duplication, and triggers re-renders in the view layer whenever data changes. The store decouples the UI from the backend, keeping the app responsive even during network delays.

In an SPA, this layer is initialized once and then persisted + updated throughout the session.

In practice, these are your state management libraries, such as

Redux

,

Zustand

,

Jotai

, etc.

Data access

The data access layer abstracts away the communication with the backend APIs.

It handles network requests, response parsing, and caching policies, and defines how data moves between the server and the store. This layer may also include retry logic, pagination handling, and transformations that convert raw API responses into normalized store-friendly structures. By centralizing all network operations here, the front end gains flexibility to change APIs, add batching, or introduce service workers without affecting the rest of the system.

In an SPA, this layer is also initialized once and persisted throughout the session, just like the store layer.

In practice, these are data-fetching libraries such as

RTK Query

,

Tanstack Query

,

Relay

,

and Apollo Client

.

Server

The server exposes HTTP endpoints for fetching timelines, posting tweets, and performing engagement actions such as likes or retweets.

While the server defines the data model and business rules, it relies on the front end to manage presentation logic, caching, and responsiveness. This layered architecture creates a clean separation of responsibilities. The view focuses on presentation; the store manages state; the data access layer handles communication; and the server provides data.

Since it’s an SPA, the store and data access layers are initialized on the first load, persisted throughout the session across navigations, and continuously updated as requests and user interactions occur.

Interface (API design)

In the architecture layers diagram, several data entities are passed around.

All of them either originate from the server or are being sent to the server. Hence, we can focus on the server APIs.

Most of these APIs require authentication as they’re personalized or specific to the user. It’s important to note that the user’s ID shouldn’t be included in the request and shouldn't be relied on as the source of truth for identity, as it can be spoofed and create a security vulnerability. The user’s identity should be derived from session cookies sent with the request.

We’ll assume the user is logged in and omit discussion of authentication and authorization mechanisms, since the focus is on the Twitter product.

1. Get Twitter timeline

GET /timeline?count=10&cursor=abc

Returns a list of tweets. Pagination parameters are included so that clients know how to fetch the next page of tweets.

We’ll look at pagination in more detail in the optimizations section.

2. Get a single tweet

GET /tweets/{id}

Returns a single tweet. Depending on the desired experience, replies can be fetched using another API (e.g.,

/tweets/{id}/replies

) or included in the tweet payload.

This API is available to the public, but if a session cookie is included in the request, the results can include personalized fields such as whether the user has liked the tweet.

3. Post a tweet

POST /tweets

Create a new tweet. It accepts the following parameters:

When creating tweets with attached media, the media is first uploaded to blob storage, and an ID is returned to include in the POST request payload. Therefore, we also need an API for uploading media.

This API creates a tweet for a user; hence, it requires authentication.

4. Upload media

POST /media/upload

Accepts binary data, uploads into blob storage, and returns a media object ID that can be included when creating a tweet. An alternative is for the API to provide a pre-signed URL that the client can use to upload directly to blob storage.

5. Tweet actions

POST /tweets/{id}/like

POST /tweets/{id}/retweet

Common actions that can be taken on tweets. There are more, but these are the two main ones.

Data model/entities

Next, let’s look at the core entities that should be modelled in a way that is both efficient for rendering and resilient to frequent updates.

Similar to backend data models, which focus on efficient storage and relationships, we can model front-end data to prioritize ease of access, normalization, and caching.

Tweet entity

At the center of the timeline is the Tweet entity.

Each tweet contains a rich set of information:

text content,

author details,

timestamps,

engagement counts,

and possibly media attachments.

On the front end, data is often stored in a normalized form rather than as nested objects.

This means separating the author data and media into distinct entities, each referenced by an ID. This approach makes updates more efficient. For example, when a user’s avatar or display name changes, every tweet referencing that user can automatically reflect the update without having redundant data.

User entity

The User entity represents the authors and participants in the timeline.

It includes metadata such as:

name,

username,

profile picture,

verification status,

and relationship flags (for example, whether the current user follows them).

Because user data is shared across many tweets and UI surfaces, it’s often cached at the global application level to avoid repeated network requests and duplicated state.

Timeline entity

The Timeline entity itself represents the ordered feed of tweets.

It can be thought of as a list of tweet IDs, annotated with pagination information for fetching older or newer tweets.

Timelines are dynamic; as the user scrolls down, older tweets are fetched and appended to the list, and newer tweets can also be added to the top when the timeline is stale.

Normalized store structure

These entities live in the client store following a normalized structure.

Data normalization within client-side stores is the process of structuring data so that each unique entity is stored exactly once, with relationships between entities represented by references rather than nested copies. This concept mirrors relational database design, but applied in the context of a browser application.

On Twitter, a tweet might include a nested user object for its author, another for a retweet, and yet another for a reply. If these user objects were duplicated across many tweets, updating a single piece of user information (e.g., a display name or avatar) would require updating every instance across the store.

Normalization prevents this by separating users, tweets, and other entities into their own collections, using their IDs as keys. Entities then store references to other entities via IDs rather than embedding full user data.

This structure makes updates and caching far more efficient. If a user’s profile changes, only the corresponding user entry needs to be updated, and every component referencing that user will automatically reflect the change.

Normalized data also simplifies pagination, deduplication, and cache merging when new results arrive from the server. Most importantly, it keeps the client-side store lean and organized as the app grows in complexity, ensuring data consistency across views and interactions.

NOTE:

Data fetched from the server

doesn’t need to be in the finalized, normalized form

.

Normalization can be done on the server or the client, depending on where the processing should occur. If a product serves markets where user devices aren’t powerful… it might be better, performance-wise, to have the server handle normalization.

As of 2025, Twitter normalizes timeline data on the server and sends a compact payload to clients.

Optimizations and deep dive

With the core pieces of the Twitter front-end system laid out, let’s look at how the app can be optimized:

We’ll look at general optimizations across the board and zoom in on specific optimizations for each part of the app.

User experience

Loading states

are the first touchpoint in this process.

When users open the app or navigate between views, the UI should always provide a clear signal that content is being retrieved, with spinners.

Twitter uses a single loading spinner, but a better approach would be to use skeleton placeholders—gray blocks resembling tweet shapes, rather than traditional spinners.

Skeleton screens preserve layout stability and make loading feel shorter because the visual structure is already in place. As data arrives, the placeholders seamlessly transition into actual content.

Error handling

requires a similarly thoughtful approach.

When something goes wrong, the interface must communicate the issue clearly without breaking immersion. For transient failures, such as a dropped network connection, the timeline can display an inline error bar or toast notification, something non-blocking that encourages the user to retry.

More severe cases, such as an empty feed because of an API failure, call for a fallback UI that explains what happened and provides recovery options.

Twitter shows a “Retry” button alongside a short message instead of a blank page, maintaining context while guiding the user back to normalcy.

Performance optimizations

Performance is one of the most critical dimensions of front-end system design, especially for an application as dynamic and content-heavy as the Twitter timeline.

Let’s look at some performance techniques:

Reducing initial page load size through code splitting

Code splitting

4

is a key performance optimization technique that allows web applications to load only the JavaScript necessary for the current view, rather than delivering the entire bundle upfront.

Twitter’s features, such as timelines, profiles, and notifications, each have distinct dependencies; sending all the code at once would significantly delay the initial load.

By splitting the code into smaller, route- or feature-specific chunks, the app reduces its initial JavaScript bundle size, improving time-to-first-render and time-to-interactive.

In Twitter, code splitting is used in the following scenarios:

Relevance

: Lazily loading only the JavaScript code for the tweet formats shown in the timeline. There are many types of tweets: text, image, video, ads, etc., and each has a different appearance and interactions. Only the code needed for the tweet formats in the timeline is downloaded.

Interaction

: Lazily loading JavaScript code for components that are only shown upon user interaction, e.g., Emojipicker when clicking on the emoji button in the composer, auto-completion of hashtags, and profile card that only appears when hovering over a tag/mention.

Navigational

: Other pages, such as the tweet detail page, can be loaded lazily when a user clicks a tweet, rather than bundled with the timeline code.

This improves performance for the average user, who might never visit certain routes or perform certain actions. Combined with pre-fetching (loading likely future chunks in the background), code splitting provides a balance between speed and flexibility.

Modern build tools like Webpack, Rollup, and Vite support dynamic imports, which make code splitting straightforward.

Optimizing rendering performance through list virtualization

The timeline consists of a long list of tweet components, each with rich media and nested interactions.

Rendering every tweet at once would overwhelm the DOM, so Twitter relies on

virtualized lists

that render only the visible items in the viewport, using invisible

<div>

s so that the scrollbars are still present without actual content.

As users scroll, off-screen elements are recycled or unmounted to minimize memory usage. This approach keeps frame rates high and prevents layout thrashing.

Improving perceived performance through optimistic updates

Optimistic updates work by immediately reflecting a user’s action in the interface before the server confirms the change, creating the illusion of zero latency.

For actions such as liking, retweeting, or following, this technique ensures that the interface reacts instantly, maintaining the sense of momentum that defines a smooth social media experience.

When a user likes a tweet, for example, the heart icon fills in and the like count increments right away. Behind the scenes, the client simultaneously sends a request to the server to record the action. If the server responds successfully, nothing more needs to happen, since the UI has already been updated. But if the request fails, the client rolls back to the previous state. This approach hides network latency from the user, making interactions feel immediate even on slow or unreliable connections.

From an engineering perspective, implementing optimistic updates requires careful state management.

The client must maintain a consistent local representation of the data and reconcile it with the server’s eventual response. Using a client store, this is made easier as data is shared across many views (e.g., the same tweet appearing on multiple pages/placements), the store tracks a tweet’s state in a normalized fashion and has to update a Tweet’s

likedCount

value by

1

and

likedByUser

to

true

; there are no duplicated instances of tweets to search through and update.

Efficient media rendering

Every tweet can contain images, GIFs, or videos, and these assets are often the largest contributors to load time and memory usage.

Hence, it’s important to optimize how media is loaded, displayed, and recycled to maintain both perceived performance and smooth scrolling.

The first principle is

lazy loading

.

Media should never be fetched or decoded until it’s near the user’s viewport. This minimizes initial bandwidth consumption and prevents layout shifts during scrolling. Modern browsers support the

loading=”lazy”

attribute for images, but more advanced control can be achieved by using the

IntersectionObserver

5

API, which allows the app to load assets slightly before they appear on screen.

For videos and GIFs, loading low-resolution thumbnails or poster frames first gives the illusion of instant availability while deferring full playback until user interaction.

Next comes

media optimization and sizing

.

Twitter’s front-end requests media in multiple resolutions and serves the appropriate variant based on device type, screen density, and layout size. This is typically achieved using the

<img srcset>

and

<picture>

elements or equivalent client-side logic. On high-density displays, high-resolution assets are used selectively to maintain visual sharpness without overfetching.

For videos, adaptive bitrate streaming ensures smooth playback even under varying network conditions, seamlessly switching between quality levels.

Finally,

perceived performance

plays a significant role.

Progressive image decoding and blurred low-resolution placeholders (often called LQIP

6

or “blurhash”) give users an instant visual cue that content is loading, reducing the sense of delay. Combined with skeleton loaders and smooth transitions, the feed feels continuously alive, even when data and media are still being fetched.

Timeline pagination approaches

Two common approaches to pagination in modern web applications are:

offset-based pagination,

cursor-based pagination.

Both are mechanisms for fetching data in chunks, but they differ in how they identify the next set of results and how well they handle dynamic, real-time data.

Offset-based pagination

It relies on numerical offsets to determine which results to fetch next.

For example, a request might specify

?offset=20&limit=10

to get the next ten tweets after the first twenty.

Offset-based pagination is straightforward and easy to implement, but it becomes inefficient and unreliable as the dataset grows or changes frequently. When new tweets are inserted into the feed, offsets can shift, leading to duplicate or missing items. It also performs poorly for large offsets

7

, as databases must skip an increasing number of records to reach the desired position.

Cursor-based pagination

Cursor-based pagination, on the other hand, uses a unique identifier (often a tweet ID or timestamp) as a cursor to mark the boundary between pages.

Instead of asking for the “next 10 results after offset 20,” the client requests “the next 10 results after tweet ID X.”

Cursor-based pagination is more stable and efficient because it doesn’t depend on the dataset’s size or ordering at query time. It works well in environments where data is frequently updated, such as Twitter’s timeline, where new tweets appear constantly and older tweets can be deleted or re-ranked.

For Twitter,

cursor-based pagination is the rational choice

.

It aligns naturally with the timeline's chronological nature, avoids inconsistencies caused by real-time updates, and scales efficiently across millions of records. It also enables bidirectional navigation, allowing users to load newer tweets and scroll down (to fetch older ones) without re-fetching or skipping content.

By combining cursor-based pagination with techniques such as infinite scrolling and background prefetching, Twitter can maintain a seamless, continuous feed experience that feels instantaneous, even as large volumes of data are loaded behind the scenes.",https://newsletter.systemdesign.one

1.

Orphaned Resources

Orphaned resources are cloud assets that are no longer in use but continue to run.

Examples:

unattached storage disks,

unused public IPs,

old snapshots.

They pile up over time, cost “money”, and clutter dashboards… thus making it harder to track what’s important.

A typical example is running a proof-of-concept on a large, expensive virtual machine and forgetting to shut it down or delete it. The VMs keep running, and the bill keeps growing until someone notices it.

Why it happens

Cloud makes it easy to create new resources. But deleting them is usually a manual task—and people forget. As every resource has a cost, even tiny leftovers add up. If left untracked, nobody knows what can be safely removed.

Architectural impact

Orphaned resources make it hard to understand where money is going. They can also create security risks. For example:

A forgotten test VM might still hold credentials.

An old IP address might still be allowed in firewall rules.

A leftover snapshot might contain sensitive data.

How to prevent it

Use tags: owner, purpose, and expiry date.

Automate the cleanup of unused or expired resources.

Send regular cost reports grouped by tags and resource age.

Add cleanup to every project’s “done” checklist.

Schedule automatic scans to find and remove old resources.

Forgotten resources quietly waste money. While configuration mistakes break systems quickly.

2. Misconfigurations

Misconfiguration is one of the most common causes of cloud incidents.

A single wrong setting or missing rule can affect reliability, security, or cost. And its impact often spreads long before anyone notices.

Examples:

Wrong autoscaling limits

Encryption not turned on for storage

A storage bucket accidentally left public

Copy-pasting templates without checking differences

When these patterns are automated, a single mistake amplifies across multiple accounts or regions.

Why it happens

Cloud services offer hundreds of settings: permissions, scaling rules, encryption options, network controls, and so on.

Teams often rely on defaults or copy settings between environments without reviewing them. When Infrastructure as Code

1

(

IaC

) templates contain errors, those errors propagate every time the template is used.

And fast release cycles make it worse; there’s rarely enough time for reviews.

Architectural impact

Misconfiguration can:

Expose sensitive services to the public

Destabilize performance

Disable encryption

Break scaling logic

Increase costs

Because cloud automation pushes changes at scale, a tiny error can impact an entire production environment within minutes.

How to prevent it

Keep configurations in version control; review and test every change.

Use policy-as-code tools (Terraform Validate, AWS Config, Azure Policy).

Detect configuration drift and automatically enforce compliance.

Keep clear configuration baselines for production and non-production systems.

Monitor continuously for anomalies or security alerts.

Strong configurations are helpful, but they only work if teams communicate effectively. The next challenge isn’t in the code… it’s in coordination.

3. Poor Communication Between Teams

Cloud systems rely on effective coordination among development, operations, security, networking, and finance teams.

If they don’t share information clearly, assumptions drift, ownership becomes unclear, and issues surface late in production.

For example:

A networking team updates routing rules for compliance, but doesn’t inform data engineers who depend on that network.

Pipelines fail the next day - not because of a bug, but because one team didn’t know what another had changed.

Why it happens

Cloud projects involve many specialties:

Developers focus on features.

Operations focus on reliability.

Security focuses on compliance.

Each team uses different tools and has different priorities.

If teams don’t share information clearly, critical details get lost. Teams may not know which workloads are important or how specific changes impact cost or performance.

Architectural impact

Poor communication causes:

Duplicate services

Inconsistent architecture

Pipelines that fail to integrate

Security exceptions approved without full context

Conflicting Identity and Access Management

2

(

IAM

) roles

During incidents, no one is sure who owns what, which slows down the response and recovery.

How to prevent it

Define clear ownership and contact points for each system or account.

Keep shared documentation and Architecture Decision Records

3

(

ADRs

).

Hold cross-team reviews for key infrastructure or cost changes.

Encourage a “you build it, you run it” mindset.

Use consistent tagging, naming, and shared communication channels (shared dashboards and so on).

Communication gaps often cause teams to take shortcuts, such as relying on a single tool to solve every problem. But that approach can backfire!

4. Believing One Tool Solves Everything

Many teams assume that a single cloud platform, monitoring tool, or automation system can handle every need.

It feels efficient at first:

One interface, one workflow, one place to learn.

But as systems grow, this approach limits flexibility… and creates more problems than it solves.

Example:

A team standardized on a single deployment tool that worked well for virtual machines (but didn’t support containers).

And developers began writing custom scripts to fill the gaps, and environments drifted apart.

So tracking changes became difficult.

Why it happens

Cloud tools evolve fast, and many are marketed as “all-in-one” solutions.

Teams under pressure to simplify or reduce costs often choose a single tool for everything: observability

, security, deployments, and so on.

At first, it seems easier to manage and train people on a single platform. But it becomes difficult over time:

The tool doesn’t scale across many accounts.

It doesn’t work well in hybrid or multi-cloud environments.

It lacks the features needed for new services.

What started as “simplicity” ends up as inflexibility.

Architectural impact

Relying on one tool can cause:

Hidden dependencies

Poor multi-cloud or hybrid support

Large parts of the system break if the tool fails

Missing metrics, especially for newer workloads

Slow innovation, as teams wait for features that may never arrive

How to prevent it

Choose tools based on fit, not just standardization.

Review tool usage regularly as your architecture evolves.

Design for interoperability

Limit the number of tools you use. Also, group tools by purpose (monitoring, IaC, deployment). Plus, assign clear ownership.

Relying just on one tool is risky. However, a deeper issue arises when there’s a lack of understanding about how the cloud actually works.

5. Weak Understanding of Cloud Mechanics

Many cloud problems come from a lack of understanding of how the cloud actually works: from billing and scaling to data movement and networking.

Without this knowledge, even well-designed systems can become expensive or unreliable.

Example:

A team built a data analytics job that copied large datasets between regions daily.

They assumed transfers were free, just like in their on-premise data center.

Their first month’s bill showed network charges higher than the compute costs.

Why it happens

Cloud platforms hide many infrastructure details.

Although this makes things easier, it doesn’t remove responsibility. Teams used to traditional environments expect fixed costs and predictable performance.

But in the cloud, everything is usage-based:

How much data you store

How much data you move

How much data you process

Services scale automatically, but not always as teams expect. There’s often a gap between how a service is described and how it behaves with real workloads.

Architectural impact

A weak understanding of cloud mechanics can cause:

Systems that scale too slowly or too fast

Inefficient storage usage (e.g., active data on slow, cheap tiers)

Silent cost growth in data transfer and API calls

Misunderstanding reliability features

8

like regional redundancy

9

or eventual consistency

10

These issues can cause high costs, data loss, or availability risks.

How to prevent it

Use cost calculators and load tests early.

Build and test small prototypes before scaling up.

Understand SLAs

11

, scaling mechanisms, and regional data flows.

Add platform training to onboarding and architecture reviews.

Test how systems behave during failures or heavy load.

Misunderstanding the platform often leads to copying old data-center patterns in the cloud. This could limit the benefits of using the cloud.

6. Rebuilding On-Prem in the Cloud

A common and costly mistake is treating the cloud like a traditional data center.

Many teams migrate their virtual machines, networks, and firewalls without changing the design. This feels safe and familiar. But it overlooks key cloud benefits, such as elasticity, automation, and managed services.

Example:

A company copied its data-center VMs and networks directly into the cloud.

Costs increased, updates remained manual, and scaling was limited.

Only after moving to managed databases and autoscaling groups did the system become efficient.

Why it happens

Most migrations happen under time pressure.

Teams take the fastest route… and lift their on-premise environment into the cloud to avoid redesign work (“lift-and-shift” strategy

12

).

But if these old habits,

Manual patching

Fixed-size servers

Strict network zones

… continue, it brings technical debt into a platform that charges for every resource used by the unit (time/call/execution).

Architectural impact

Rebuilding on-premise in the cloud can cause:

Poor use of managed services

High costs from fixed-size infrastructure

Limited scalability because of manual maintenance

Weak resilience compared to cloud-native designs

Overreliance on network-based security instead of identity-based access

These issues make systems harder to scale, more expensive to run, and slower to recover.

How to prevent it

Modernize step by step: start small and iterate slowly.

Adopt cloud-native services where they reduce effort.

Use identity and roles as the primary security boundary.

Design for flexibility and modularity, so the system evolves.

Run pilot projects to test scaling, recovery, and automation patterns.

After moving to the cloud, structure and visibility become critical. Without proper governance, even small setups can turn chaotic.

7. Missing Governance: No Tags, No Naming, No Monitoring

Without clear governance, even well-built cloud environments quickly become confusing.

When resources have unclear names, lack tags, or are not monitored, costs increase and ownership becomes unclear.

Teams can’t answer simple questions like:

Who owns this?

What is it for?

Can we delete it?

Example:

A company discovered that half of its monthly bill was because of untracked compute instances and unused storage.

None had tags or meaningful names.

It took weeks to trace the ownership.

And only after adding tagging rules and cost dashboards could they safely remove the unnecessary resources.

Why it happens

Early in the cloud adoption process, teams focus on speed rather than structure.

They create resources fast, without standard tags or names. And as the environment grows across projects and regions, these missing details become a problem:

Monitoring and cost alerts are added too late

Nobody knows which VM supports production

Or which storage bucket belongs to a retired project

As a result, the environment becomes difficult to understand.

Architectural impact

Missing governance leads to:

Poor visibility and unclear ownership

Security teams unable to trace exposed resources

Finance unable to link costs to owners or projects

Untracked resources piling up and wasting money

Automation tools failing because of missing tags and names

How to prevent it

Use clear and consistent naming conventions.

Treat governance as core architecture, not as cleanup work.

Centralize monitoring, cost reporting, and alerting across all accounts.

Use governance tools (AWS Config, Azure Policy, GCP Organization Policies).

Define mandatory tagging standards: owner, environment, purpose, cost center, and expiry.

Good governance improves visibility. But it doesn’t guarantee security, especially when teams rely too much on network boundaries and overlook identity and access controls.

8. Treating Network as the Main Security Layer

In traditional data centers, the network perimeter is usually the primary line of defense:

You could isolate systems, add firewalls, control traffic, and so on.

But in the cloud, that model no longer works. Identity and permissions now define the real security boundary… yet many teams still rely mainly on network rules and overlook identity.

Example:

A company isolated workloads in private subnets.

But they gave broad permissions to their automation tools.

When a CI/CD credential was compromised, attackers could access data directly through APIs.

The network stayed closed, but identity access was enough to cause damage.

Why it happens

Teams coming from on-premise environments often bring the same perimeter-based mindset into the cloud.

They continue using:

VPNs

13

IP allow lists

Tight subnets

This approach may work in small setups, but cloud environments are constantly evolving. Many services, such as serverless functions and managed databases, live outside fixed networks altogether.

Architectural impact

Relying too heavily on network controls causes:

Blind spots in security

Strict rules blocking valid communication

Misconfigured firewalls exposing internal systems

No protection against identity-based attacks (the most common breach type)

How to prevent it

Treat identity (IAM roles, service accounts, least-privilege policies

14

) as the first layer of defense.

Use network rules as an extra layer of protection, not as the core security layer.

Apply zero-trust principles

15

: verify every request based on identity and context, not location.

Review access paths regularly and use automated policy validation tools.

Prefer private endpoints

16

and managed connectivity for sensitive services over custom VPNs.

Solid security foundations are essential, but resilience also requires flexibility. Static designs fail… as soon as conditions change.

9. Static Designs That Don’t Handle Change

Cloud systems are built to adapt:

Services evolve, usage changes, and regions shift.

But many teams design architectures as if nothing will ever change. Static, rigid designs may look stable at first… yet they fail the moment workloads, connections, or platform features change.

Example:

An application launched with fixed VM clusters and manual scaling.

During seasonal peaks, performance dropped sharply, so engineers had to add capacity manually.

After switching to autoscaling (with limits) and serverless processing, the system automatically handled the load and “reduced costs” during quiet periods.

Why it happens

Teams coming from on-premise environments often use a “set it and forget it” mindset. They keep the old patterns:

Hardcode limits

Fixed-size clusters

Manual deployments

Sometimes internal rules (long approval queues or fear of automation mistakes) also slow down change. The result is a system that works for current traffic but can’t grow with demand.

Architectural impact

Static designs lead to:

Poor scalability

Crashes during traffic spikes

Slow recovery during incidents

Wasted money during low traffic

Infrastructure that becomes outdated as services evolve

They also discourage testing and experimentation.

How to prevent it

Design for elasticity: autoscaling, serverless, and event-driven models.

Use infrastructure as code for flexible and repeatable deployments.

Version configurations and test changes with

blue-green or canary

releases.

Review the architecture regularly as usage and platform features evolve.

Introduce chaos testing to validate how systems respond to failure.

A system that can’t adapt is one problem. But even flexible systems waste money if development environments mirror production too closely.

10. Treating Development Like Production (Same Tiers, Policies, Permissions)

Development and production should NOT look identical.

When both environments use the same instance sizes, retention rules, and permissions, the result isn’t better control; it’s unnecessary cost and reduced flexibility.

Development should be a safe environment for testing ideas… not a complete replica of the production environment.

Example:

Every test stack used the same compute tiers, observability tools, and storage.

A company cloned its entire production setup into development to “keep things consistent”.

Within months, development costs reached almost half of the production costs.

Why it happens

Teams often copy production settings into dev or test environments to avoid surprises. But in the cloud,

Broad permissions

Long retention rules

Strict production policies

… and identical configurations slow development, increase costs, and limit experimentation.

Architectural impact

Treating all environments the same leads to:

Unused data piling up

Broad permissions exposing secrets

High costs from expensive dev resources

Strict rules blocking quick tests or experiments

A slow, rigid setup that adds little value between releases

How to prevent it

Use smaller, cheaper instance types for non-production environments.

Set different permission levels for development and production.

Define separate budgets, data retention rules, and access policies.

Use anonymized or synthetic data

17

instead of production data.

Tune monitoring and alerts for each environment’s purpose.

Automate provisioning with clear parameters per environment (dev, test, prod).

As environments grow, tracking costs across accounts becomes difficult. Without visibility, spending becomes hard to explain and control.

11. No Cost Visibility

Cloud costs become clear only when someone actually tracks them…

Many teams run for months without knowing where their money is going. And this can quickly erode trust from finance and leadership.

Example:

A project stored large datasets across many buckets.

Without cost reports, nobody noticed that storage and data transfer costs were growing faster than compute.

After adding tagging rules and cost dashboards, the team identified unused datasets and significantly reduced the monthly bill.

Why it happens

Cloud billing provides detailed information but involves complexity.

Costs spread across services, regions, and accounts. And without proper structure, it’s hard to understand who is spending what.

Common causes:

No tagging

No centralized reporting

No shared dashboards

If you prioritize speed without tracking costs, it creates “mystery spend”, where everyone assumes someone else is monitoring usage.

Architectural impact

Poor cost visibility leads to:

Slow or stalled optimization efforts

Over-provisioned or idle resources staying online

Design and scaling decisions disconnected from financial reality

Storage and autoscaling choices that cost more than expected

Teams afraid to delete resources because the impact is unknown

How to prevent it

Assign clear cost ownership to teams.

Tag resources by cost center, owner, and environment.

Use built-in cost tools (AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management, GCP Billing Reports).

Set budgets, forecasts, and anomaly alerts per project or account.

Review cost data regularly in architecture and operations meetings.

Add dashboards that show spend trends alongside performance metrics.

Poor cost visibility often hides waste, and one common reason is collecting too much data.",https://newsletter.systemdesign.one

What is a Stock Exchange? (The Simple Answer)

Imagine the stock market as a farmer’s market.

Each stock is like a stall area in the market where people gather to buy or sell a product. More trade brings more PROFIT for the stock exchange through fees. So their job is to facilitate as many “transactions” as possible. Each seller can set up a stall and specify the price they’re willing to sell for.

If nobody buys, they might lower their price.

Buyers want the cheapest price, so they usually go to the stall offering the lowest price first.

In an “ideal” world, buyers would stand in a queue, ordered by the price they’re willing to pay for fairness. This means buyers offering higher prices stand closer to the front. Plus, a buyer can adjust their position in the queue by changing the price they’re willing to pay. A trade occurs when a buyer’s price meets or exceeds a seller’s price.

That’s when the exchange matches them!

In simple words:

BUY orders get sorted in decreasing order (highest bid first).

SELL orders get sorted in increasing order (buy as cheaply as possible).

The point where they overlap is the market price.

In reality, it’s much more complicated… but this is the basic idea.

Let’s Start with

Requirements

Don’t worry, it’s simple!

An exchange that trades ONLY stocks.

Users can place a BUY or SELL order.

Also users can cancel their order at any time.

Exchange must match buyers and sellers in real time.

And restrict the number of shares a user can trade per day.

It should also publish market data

1

in real-time.

Exchanges

2

make trading fair and transparent.

In most of them:

New orders = ~50% messages,

Cancels = ~40% messages,

Executions = ~2% messages.

The rest is... noise.

Trading Terms

(Simplified)

Broker

:

An app or site

3

that lets users BUY or SELL, and view prices from an exchange.

Order Book

:

A list of all current BUY and SELL orders for a stock, showing who wants to buy or sell, how much, and at what price.

Market Order

:

A BUY or SELL order where you don’t set a price. It executes immediately at the current market price, as long as there’s enough liquidity

4

. Plus, it receives priority in the order book.

Limit Order

:

A BUY or SELL order where you choose the “exact” price.

Example:

Buy at $100 → fills

5

at $100 or lower.

Sell at $100 → fills at $100 or higher.

Spread

:

The difference between the highest BUY price and the lowest SELL price.

Profit Formula

:

Profit = Sell price - Buy price

(So buy low, sell high.)

Stock Exchange Architecture

An exchange interacts with many “external” services:

Live chat support.

CAPTCHA implementation.

User data management & tracking.

Service for sending emails, text messages, and mobile app notifications.

But let’s focus on the core design itself…

Its architecture is asynchronous and event-sourced.

6

Here are the three key components of an exchange:

Broker - allows people to buy and sell stocks on the exchange.

Gateway - entry point for brokers to send BUY or SELL orders to the exchange.

Matching Engine - component that matches buy and sell orders to create trades.

Let’s dive in!

1. Broker

A broker interacts with an exchange to:

Send order requests - place orders, receive status updates, and access trade information.

Receive market data - historical data for analysis, stream live trade data, and so on.

A user connects to the broker using REST APIs and WebSockets for real-time data transfer. While brokers use the Financial Information Exchange (

FIX

) protocol to communicate with the gateway.

FIX is a bidirectional communication protocol for secure data exchange through a “public network”.

7

It assigns unique sequence numbers to order messages. Besides, it uses checksums and message length to verify data integrity

8

.

2. Gateway

It receives orders from brokers and converts

9

them into the exchange’s internal format. Then it sends

10

the trade execution results back to the users. It’s also possible to put a gateway near exchange servers (

co-location

) for low latency.

A gateway has three key parts:

Risk Manager - ensures the user has enough funds and blocks any unusual trading activity. Also, it determines exchange fees.

Wallet - stores the user’s funds and assets for trading.

Order Manager - assigns sequence numbers for fairness and updates order states. Plus, it sends cleared orders to the matching engine.

Let’s dive in…

Gateway validates an order

11

with the risk manager and wallet service.

Then it passes the request to the order manager. Think of the

order manager

12

as a lightweight list containing ALL orders: open, cancelled, and rejected ones. It updates the order state and handles cancel requests.

Order manager assigns a globally increasing sequence number to each order (trade or cancel) and execution fill (for both BUY and SELL).

Gateway Internal Architecture

A sequence number guarantees:

Ordering for fairness, timeliness, and accuracy.

Fast recovery and deterministic replay.

Exactly once guarantee.

Plus, sequence numbers make it easy to find missing events in both inbound and outbound sequences

13

.

After clearance, the order manager routes the order to the matching engine.

Each message type (new order, cancel, trade) has its own topic queue, with its own sequence numbers. This separation helps to:

Maintain order within each stream.

Process each message type independently and reduce contention.

And make recovery easier as the exchange could “replay” events per topic in exact order.

Let’s keep going!

3. Matching Engine

It verifies sequence numbers, matches BUY and SELL orders, and creates market data based on trades

14

.

A matching engine has two key parts:

Order Book

15

- an in-memory list of BUY and SELL orders.

Matching Logic - matches BUY and SELL orders and sends those trade results as market data.

Let’s dive in…

Order Book

It keeps an in-memory list

16

of open orders for each stock

17

(symbol).

There are actually two lists for each stock:

One for BUY orders,

Another one for SELL orders.

Each list gets sorted by price and timestamp in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.

And each price level gets a separate queue of orders (doubly linked list):

New orders get added at the tail - O(1) time complexity.

Filled or canceled orders get removed from the queue using a pointer

18

- O(1) time complexity.

It keeps track of the highest bid and lowest ask for quick matching. For example, BUY@96 and SELL@98.

Searching through all price levels and linked lists could be slow - O(n). So it uses an index to map order IDs to the order object in memory: order ID → pointer (reference). It allows fast cancellations by looking up the order by ID in the index in O(1) and then setting the amount to 0.

A closed order gets removed from the order book and gets added to the transaction history.

Matching Logic

It checks if a message follows the correct sequence and matches BUY and SELL orders when:

buy price ≥ sell price

The same order sequence (input) must always produce the same execution sequence (output). So the matching function must be fast and accurate, and deterministic.

Good tests prevent regressions and show how code should work. So verify whether the new code has “sufficient” test coverage.

Choose the correct reviewer for each change: code owners or domain experts can quickly catch domain-specific issues. If you assign many reviewers,,, ensure each understands their responsibilities to prevent delays.

Write clear pull request descriptions that explain the “what” and “why” of changes. Also, link relevant tickets and attach screenshots that help reviewers understand the context.

Use a code review CHECKLIST. It could cover design, readability, security, testing, and so on. This ensures consistency in reviews and reduces the chances of missing common issues.

Automate easy parts. Use tests, linters, and static analysis to catch errors and style issues. This way, reviewers can focus on logic & architecture.

I’m happy to partner with

Use review metrics to find “bottlenecks”. Measure: review time and bug rates, and pull request size. Then adjust the process based on data to improve speed without sacrificing quality.

Review quickly… but don’t rush! The goal is to improve code health, not just quick approvals.

Keep reviews SHORT. It’s hard to stay focused after reading 100+ lines of code. If the change is big, break it up into smaller parts or focus on one section at a time to give effective feedback.

Get early feedback on big features to save time later. This helps to catch issues early and makes reviews more manageable.

Ask for a review ONLY after tests & builds pass. This prevents wasting the reviewer’s time on broken code. Besides, it signals the code is stable enough to review.

Use review tools effectively to save time - threaded comments, suggested edits, and templates, and so on. The correct setup makes reviews smoother.

Watch out for potential bugs & logic mistakes that tests might miss. Think about “race conditions or extreme inputs”. Human reviewers can often spot bugs that automated tests miss, especially in complex logic.

Encourage ALL team members to take part in code reviews. And don’t let the same people handle all reviews. Rotation spreads knowledge and avoids burnout.

You can’t review code effectively if you don’t understand what it does. So read the code carefully and run it locally if necessary.

Keep the feedback within the “scope”. If you notice any issues outside the scope of the change, log them separately. This keeps reviews constructive and prevents endless delays.

Review in layers: design then details. This approach helps you catch both major and minor issues efficiently.

Compare the implementation with the requirements. Ensure it handles acceptance criteria and edge cases and error conditions correctly.

Enforce coding standards for CONSISTENCY. Suggest refactoring if the logic is hard to follow.

Use AI tools to summarize changes or find issues. It saves time! But use those as a helper... and not a replacement for human reviews.

Guess what? When you open a pull request,

CodeRabbit

can generate a summary of code changes for the reviewer. It helps them quickly understand complex changes and assess the impact on the codebase. Speed up the code review process.

Try CodeRabbit

Set clear “guidelines” for how reviews get approved. For example, have at least two reviewers for critical code changes.

Consider how code performs at scale in “performance-critical” areas. Look out for things that might cause slowdowns in critical paths - unnecessary loops and so on. Remember: fixing issues is easier during review than in production.

Use reviews as an opportunity to share KNOWLEDGE and grow together. Share tips and best practices, especially with junior engineers.

Ensure the code handles errors “gracefully”. Functions must deal with null inputs or external call failures without crashing. Good error handling makes the system robust & easy to debug.

Adjust practices to fit your team’s needs. What works at one company might not work for another. Keep experimenting until you find your ideal flow.

Always review with the bigger picture in mind. Think about how the change interacts with the codebase. And consider cross-cutting concerns: performance, concurrency, and backward compatibility.

It’s better to clarify… than to assume. So ask clarifying questions when something is unclear about the change. A simple question can prevent misunderstandings or reveal missing requirements.

If possible, run the code locally, especially for complex & critical code changes. Seeing it in action can reveal issues that reading won’t.

Focus on code correctness & clarity,,, not personal style. If an issue is purely stylistic and not covered by a guideline, consider letting it pass or marking it as a nitpick. Remember, reviews are about improving the codebase.

Suggest a solution when pointing out a problem. If a function is complex, propose breaking it into smaller functions or using a design pattern. Reviews are most valuable when they teach… not just criticize.

Consider whether the documentation requires any updates because of the change. An API change may need changes to the API docs or the README file. Ensure everything remains accurate and complete.

Treat code review as a “team effort”, not a fight. Focus on making the product better rather than proving someone wrong. A friendly tone makes feedback easier to accept.

Mention explicitly which comments are essential & which are optional. Label important fixes separately from small “nice-to-have” ideas. This helps the author to prioritize and stay focused.

Bet you didn’t know…

CodeRabbit CLI

brings instant code reviews directly to your terminal, seamlessly integrating with Claude Code, Cursor CLI, and other AI coding agents. While they generate code, CodeRabbit ensures it’s production-ready - catching bugs, security issues, and AI hallucinations before they hit your codebase.

Install CodeRabbit CLI

Involve a neutral third party in disagreements over CRITICAL issues - ask a tech lead or architect. Also, create a follow-up task if the problem is outside the current scope.

Explain the “why” behind your feedback. Understanding the reason behind feedback helps others learn. This way, they’re less likely to repeat the issue.

Secure code protects users and the business. So always think about SECURITY. Be cautious of weak data validation, exposed data, or improper error handling.

Be open to discussion when opinions differ. Ask for the author’s reasoning and listen before insisting. Talking through disagreements often leads to better solutions.

Point out what’s done well too… it motivates people to keep doing it. Keep a balance between criticism and appreciation for high morale.

Don’t use code reviews for PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS! Reviews exist to improve code, not to measure people. When engineers feel safe, they write better code & review honestly.

Respond to feedback with curiosity,,, not defensiveness. Treat comments as learning opportunities.

Having another set of eyes helps catch mistakes. So make sure someone else reviews “every” change. Even small changes benefit from peer review.

I could go on and on and on.

But if those 42 ways aren’t enough to 10x your code reviews, then probably anything else I say will go in one ear and right out the other.

If you’re coming from the backend, you probably think the frontend is just “HTML, CSS, maybe some JavaScript.” But honestly? Modern frontend engineering has grown into something much closer to backend system design.

Just like your APIs need to be fast, scalable, and reliable, frontend apps also have to handle millions of users, load content quickly, and stay observable and secure.

This newsletter is a quick introduction to frontend system design.

We’ll take concepts you already know from the backend, like caching, deployment pipelines, observability, and security, and see how they apply in the browser.

By the end, you’ll see that the frontend isn’t just about buttons and forms. It’s about building systems that run right in the user’s browser.

Rendering & Delivery Models

One of the first things to understand is how webpages reach your users.

The way you build and load them affects how fast, reliable, and smooth your site feels. You can pre-build pages, render them on the server, build them in the browser, or mix these approaches.

Building web pages works much like a server handles API responses. The trade-offs change depending on when and where the HTML gets generated.

Let’s start with pre-built pages and move to fully dynamic ones. We’ll see how each affects speed, scalability, and content freshness.

1 Static Site Generation (SSG)

Before SSG, websites worked in two fundamental ways. The server either built the page for every request, or the browser built it on the client side. That means:

Every request needed work to generate the page.

Pages could get slow if many people visit at once.

Caching was tricky, so scaling was hard.

SSG solves this by pre-building the HTML when you deploy your site. The system can fetch data during the build process, even for pages with dynamic content, which means all content is baked into static HTML files before any user visits them.

During the build process, the framework executes data-fetching code, queries your database, and generates complete HTML files for each route. The framework then uploads them to your CDN or hosting provider.

When users request a page, they receive a fully formed HTML document immediately, without waiting for server-side processing or client-side data fetching.

This makes SSG super fast for users because there’s no rendering delay. The trade-off is that if your content changes, you’ll need to rebuild and redeploy to update the static files, which is why SSG works best for content that doesn’t change frequently.

It’s like preparing API responses in advance; the hard work is done before anyone asks.

Why it matters:

Pages load super fast.

Easy to handle millions of users.

SEO is better because pages get fully rendered from the start.

Use case:

Documentation sites, marketing landing pages, or personal blogs where content updates happen through deployments, not user actions.

2 Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

Static Site Generation (SSG) is fast, but what if your content changes frequently? Rebuilding the whole site every time would be a pain.

That’s where Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) comes in.

Pages are still pre-built, but they can update automatically without a full redeploy.

You just set a revalidation time; after that period, the next visitor triggers a background rebuild of that specific page on the server, not a full deployment. The old version loads instantly, so users don’t wait. After regeneration, the new version replaces the cached one. This occurs per page, not site-wide, allowing you to set different revalidation intervals for individual pages.

It’s like cached API responses with an expiry timer; users might glimpse an older version until it’s refreshed, but the update happens quietly behind the scenes.

Why it matters:

Just as fast as SSG, but the content stays fresh.

Perfect for dynamic websites like blogs or e-commerce sites.

Works with CDNs, so updates happen without downtime.

Use case:

E-commerce product pages where most content (e.g., descriptions or images) is static, but some parts, like prices or stock info, update occasionally.

ISR keeps the page fresh without full redeploys, while real-time data, such as live prices, can come from APIs.

3 Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) works the other way around: the server builds the page for each request. It fetches the data, generates the HTML, and sends it to the user.

Unlike Static Site Generation (SSG), which is great for mostly static pages, SSR is useful when content needs to stay fresh or personalised. For example, dashboards, user profiles, or live feeds. Because the system generates pages in real time, they always display the latest data instead of relying on pre-built files.

Think of it like a regular API endpoint; everything gets computed on demand.

Why it matters:

Keeps content fresh and easy to personalise.

Perfect for pages that need real-time data or personalised content.

Note:

Under heavy traffic, SSR can slow down because it builds each page on demand, but caching can help balance load and speed.

Use case:

Social media feeds, admin dashboards, or user-specific pages where content varies by session.

4 Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

CSR means the browser does most of the work instead of the server. The server sends only a basic HTML page and some JavaScript. The browser then loads the data and builds the page on the fly.

This approach is useful when you need rich interactivity, real-time updates, or pages that change often based on user actions  - things that static or server-rendered pages can’t handle easily.

Think of it like sending raw JSON and letting the client put it together.

Note:

The first page load can be slower because the browser needs to download and run JavaScript before showing the content. Since pages get built in the browser, search engines might not see them immediately, so you might need extra setup like pre-rendering or server-side rendering for better SEO.

Why it matters:

Reduces pressure on the server.

Makes the app more interactive and responsive.

Works best for apps people use for a long time, like dashboards or editors.

Use case:

Complex apps like Figma, Notion, or Google Docs, where the app is highly interactive and users stay on the page for extended sessions.

5 Hybrid Rendering

Sometimes, one approach just isn’t enough.

Different parts of your app might have different needs. For example, some pages stay mostly the same, while others need fresh or personalised data. That’s where hybrid rendering comes in.

It mixes different strategies:

Server-side rendering (SSR) for pages that need live or personalised content,

Static site generation (SSG) for pages that rarely change,

And client-side rendering (CSR) for sections with lots of interactivity.

Think of it like combining pre-computed API responses with on-demand endpoints - all in the same system.

Why it matters:

You get the best of everything: speed, fresh content, and interactivity.

Allows you to choose the right approach for each page or component.

Reduces overloading the server while keeping content dynamic where needed.

Use case:

Large-scale apps like e-commerce platforms often combine different rendering strategies:

The homepage and category pages use static generation for speed.

Product pages use incremental static regeneration to keep content fresh.

User account pages use server-side rendering for personalised data.

The shopping cart uses client-side rendering for real-time updates without page reloads.

6 Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) & Edge Delivery

No matter which rendering method you choose, serving content efficiently is super important. CDNs keep copies of your static files on servers worldwide. This lets users download them from a nearby location instead of your main server.

This is especially useful for global audiences. For example, when someone in India visits a site hosted in the US, the CDN delivers the content from a local server, making it load much faster.

Edge rendering takes this idea a step further. Instead of just serving static files, it can actually run code or build pages at the edge, closer to the user, which reduces latency even more.

Think of it like having caches and compute nodes near your users, so requests go to a nearby server instead of your main database.

Why it matters:

Faster load times everywhere.

Easy to scale to millions of users.

Works perfectly with SSG, ISR, SSR, or hybrid setups.

Use case:

Any globally distributed application. Media sites like The New York Times use CDNs to serve articles instantly worldwide.

Performance & Optimisation

Now that you understand how your pages get rendered, the next obvious question is, “

How quickly do they actually load?

”

Even the most beautiful app can be frustrating if it takes too long to open or lags while being used. In frontend system design, speed really matters.

Let’s dive in!

7 Web Performance Metrics

To really understand your app’s speed, there are a few key metrics you should watch closely:

TTFB (Time to First Byte):

The time it takes for your browser to get the first piece of data back from the server or CDN after making a request.

FCP (First Contentful Paint):

The moment when something first appears on the screen, like text, an image, or a button, so the user knows the page is loading.

LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):

The time it takes for the main part of the page, like a large image or headline, to fully appear on the screen.

CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):

It measures how much the page layout jumps around while loading, like when text or buttons suddenly shift because images or ads are still loading.

These are basically the frontend versions of response time, throughput, and latency in backend systems. It’s important to keep a close eye on them; users can notice even minor delays of a few hundred milliseconds.

Why it matters:

You can spot slow pages before users even notice.

Improves engagement and reduces bounce rates.

Helps guide your optimisations for a smoother experience.

Use case:

E-commerce sites must optimise for LCP (product images) and CLS (avoid layout shifts during checkout). News sites focus on FCP to show headlines quickly.

8 Lazy Loading

Of course, fast pages aren’t just about metrics; they’re also about smart resource management.

Not everything on a page needs to load immediately. Lazy loading means loading heavy assets, like images, videos, or big components, only when they’re actually needed.

This works by using techniques like the

Intersection Observer API

or conditional imports, which tell the browser to fetch those resources only when they come into view or are triggered by user interaction.

It’s like fetching extra data from an API only when the user asks for it.

Why it matters:

Cuts down the initial load time.

Makes the pages feel faster and smoother.

Saves bandwidth for users who don’t need everything immediately.

Use case:

Image-heavy sites like Pinterest or Instagram use lazy loading extensively; images below the fold don’t load until you scroll.

9 Service Workers & Caching

Once you’ve optimised loading, you can make your app faster and more reliable using service workers and caching.

Service workers are background scripts that run in a separate thread from your main web page. They can intercept network requests and cache important files or data, helping your app load faster and even work offline.

Think of them as a smart middle layer between the browser and the network; if something is already cached, it’s served instantly instead of being fetched again.

Why it matters:

Speeds up repeat visits.

Reduces the load on servers.

Keeps apps usable even with poor or no internet connection.

Use case:

Progressive Web Apps like Twitter Lite or Starbucks PWA, which cache core UI and recent content, so users can browse even on unstable mobile networks.

Data & State Management

Once your UI loads quickly, the next step is to think about the data behind it.

In real apps, this data (also called state) can come from different places:

Some live inside a single component

(a reusable piece of the UI, like a button),

Some are shared across the app,

And others come from APIs.

How you manage this state can make or break your app’s speed, reliability, and scalability.

10 State Management (Local, Global, Server Cache)

Local state:

data that lives inside a single component, used for things like toggles, forms, or small interactions. It’s simple to manage and doesn’t add much complexity.

Global state:

data that’s shared across multiple components or pages, like user info or theme settings. Tools like

Redux

,

Zustand

, or

React Context

help manage it.

Server cache:

stores frequently used API data on the client so the app doesn’t have to fetch it again and again, making it faster and reducing server load.

Think of it like database caching: by deciding where data should live, you can make your app more responsive, reliable, and easier to scale.

Why it matters:

Keeps your app responsive.

Reduces unnecessary API calls.

Makes scaling smoother as your app grows.

Use case:

Local state for a modal’s open/closed status. Global state for theme preference (dark mode) that affects every component. Server-side cache for user profile data displayed by multiple components.

11 API Caching with Expiration

Caching doesn’t stop at the component level. You can store API responses in memory,

IndexedDB

(a browser database for larger data)

,

or

localStorage

(for smaller key-value data)

,

and set expiration rules to make sure data stays fresh.

It’s like having a Redis cache server, but right in the browser instead of on your server.

Why it matters:

Keeps data up-to-date for users.

Reduces repeated server requests.

Makes your app feel faster.

Use case:

A news app might cache articles for a few minutes so users can read offline, while comments refresh more often to stay up to date. Similarly, a SaaS dashboard could cache chart data while the user is on the page, then refresh it when they come back later.

12 GraphQL vs REST (Reducing Over/Under-Fetching)

How you fetch data also affects performance.

REST:

Can sometimes send too much data or not enough, making your app fetch extra information or require additional requests.

GraphQL:

A query language for APIs that lets the client ask for exactly the data it needs, avoiding extra or missing information. This avoids over-fetching or under-fetching data and helps reduce unnecessary requests.

It’s like how you optimise database queries on the backend to make them faster and use less bandwidth, but this happens on the frontend.

GraphQL sits between the client and the server as one endpoint. The client asks for exactly the data it needs, and the server’s GraphQL layer collects that data from databases or other APIs, then sends back a clean, organised response.

This way, you make one flexible request instead of several REST calls, making it faster and more data-efficient.

Why it matters:

Saves bandwidth, especially on mobile networks.

Reduces unnecessary requests.

Simplifies client-side data handling.

Use case:

GraphQL works best for complex apps that need data from many places at once, like GitHub. One GraphQL query can get a pull request, comments, and author info in a single request instead of several REST calls. While REST is simpler and great for apps with stable data, like blogs or public APIs that rely on caching.

13 Pagination Strategies (Cursor vs Offset)

Loading large lists or tables all at once can be heavy. Pagination helps break the data into manageable chunks.

Offset pagination:

Uses page numbers or record counts (like

?page=2

or

?offset=20

) to fetch data. It’s simple and works well for lists that don’t change often. But the list order shifts if new items are added or old ones are removed. This can make the same offset return different items, leading to duplicates or missing entries.

Cursor pagination:

Uses a pointer to mark where the last item ended, so the next request starts right after it. It’s more reliable for live or frequently updated data (social feeds or chat messages) because it keeps track of the exact position in the dataset. That means even if new items are added or removed while you’re scrolling, you won’t see duplicates or miss entries.

Why it matters:

Handles large datasets efficiently.

Prevents slowdowns and performance bottlenecks.

Keeps dynamic lists reliable and consistent.

Use case:

Offset pagination:

best for data tables with stable data and clear page numbers, such as admin panels or product catalogs.

Cursor pagination

: ideal for infinite scroll feeds like social media timelines, notification lists, or any real-time list where items are frequently added or removed.

14 Real-Time Data & Networking (WebSockets, SSE, Polling)

Finally, some apps need live updates, like chat apps, dashboards, or notifications. How you handle real-time data matters.

WebSockets:

Let the client and server send messages to each other in real time, both ways, without constantly asking for updates.

Server-Sent Events (SSE):

The server can push updates to the client in real time, but communication only goes one way, from server to client.

Polling:

The client regularly asks the server for updates. It’s simple to set up, but it can put more load on the server.

It’s like building event-driven systems on the backend, but here it happens in the browser.

Why it matters:

Supports live dashboards, chat, and notifications.

Improves interactivity and user engagement.

Allows you to choose the right strategy for your app’s needs.

Use case:

WebSockets:

chat apps (Slack), multiplayer games, collaborative editing (Google Docs).

SSE:

live notifications, stock tickers, server logs streaming to a dashboard.

Polling:

simple use cases like checking for new emails or status updates.

Architecture & Scalability

As your app grows, managing complexity becomes just as important as writing features. Frontend architecture isn’t just about code; it’s about building systems that are maintainable, scalable, and predictable.

15 Micro Frontends

When multiple teams work on the same app, things can get messy fast.

Micro frontends let each team build and deploy their part of the app separately. For example, one team handles the dashboard while another builds the settings page. Technically, the app is divided into smaller frontend projects that are combined at runtime to work as one seamless app.

A module federation feature (for example, in tools like

Webpack

) lets these separate projects share code (like components or utilities) directly in the browser, without rebuilding or duplicating code across projects.

Why it matters:

Teams can develop features faster and in parallel.

Reduces duplicated code across bundles.

Supports independent deployment cycles, so updates don’t block each other.

Use case:

Large enterprises with multiple teams working on different product areas. For example, big companies like

Zalando, IKEA, DAZN, and Spotify use micro-frontends

so each team can build and release their part of the app on their own.

16 Component-Based Architecture & Design Systems

Components are the building blocks of your app. A design system ensures these components stay consistent and reusable across teams and projects.

It’s like having reusable backend modules or libraries, but for your UI.

Why it matters:

Makes the UI predictable and easier to maintain.

Encourages code reuse across pages and projects.

Helps teams scale efficiently without creating chaos.

Use case:

Used by companies with many products or teams to keep design consistent, like

Shopify’s Polaris

or

IBM’s Carbon

, which are open-source design systems containing ready-to-use UI components, styles, and guidelines.

Even small startups benefit: a shared set of 10–20 components (like buttons and modals) helps teams build faster and keep the UI consistent.

17 Build & Deployment Pipelines (CI/CD for Frontend)

Frontend apps also benefit from CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines, just like backend services. These pipelines automatically handle steps like building the app, running tests, and deploying updates.

In simple terms, every time you push code, CI/CD tools check that nothing breaks and then safely release the latest version, making deployments faster, more reliable, and less manual.

Why it matters:

Minimises human errors during deployment.

Enables fast, reliable releases.

Makes scaling and frequent updates much smoother.

Use case:

Works for any app with regular updates, from small teams auto-deploying to Vercel to big companies like Netflix releasing thousands of times a day. It keeps updates fast, safe, and reliable.

User Experience & Reliability

Your users don’t care about your architectures or caching strategies; they just want the app to be fast, reliable, and easy to use.

18 Accessibility (a11y) & Mobile-First Design

Accessibility and mobile-first design aren’t just design principles; they’re system-level considerations. Accessibility ensures your app’s UI and code structure work for everyone, including people using assistive technologies.

Mobile-first design forces you to build efficient layouts, load lighter assets, and prioritize key features, all of which influence performance, scalability, and overall frontend architecture.

Why it matters:

Reaches more users.

Makes your app easier and more pleasant to use.

Ensures a consistent experience across devices.

Use case:

Government sites (accessibility is legally required in many countries), e-commerce, and content platforms. Mobile-first is essential for apps in developing markets where mobile is the main or only device.

19 Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) & Offline-First

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps that behave like native apps. They can work offline, send notifications, and even be installed on a device.

They use a few key technologies:

Service workers run in the background to cache important files like HTML, CSS, and API responses.

A web app manifest defines how the app looks and behaves when installed.

And HTTPS keeps everything secure.

Together, these make the app fast, reliable, and installable.

Why it matters:

Users can access your app anywhere.

Reduces load on servers.

Improves reliability and user trust.

Use case:

Apps where offline access is valuable: Twitter Lite, Starbucks PWA, field service apps, and news apps.

20 Security Basics (XSS, CSRF, CSP, Authentication)

Speed means nothing without security. Frontend isn’t just about the UI; it’s also the first line of defence for your app.

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):

Stop attackers from injecting malicious scripts into your app.

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):

Protect your forms and actions that change data from being triggered by attackers without the user’s consent.

CSP (Content Security Policy):

A rule set that helps prevent malicious scripts from running in your app.

Authentication:

Make sure user tokens and sessions are stored and handled securely in the browser.

Why it matters:

Protects your users and their data.

Prevents common attacks before they reach the backend.

Builds trust and helps with compliance.

Use case:

Any app handling sensitive data. Financial apps need strict CSP and token handling. Social platforms must prevent XSS to avoid account takeovers. E-commerce sites need CSRF protection on checkout to prevent unauthorised purchases.

21 Observability & Error Monitoring (Client-Side)

Even if everything works well, things can still break in production. That’s why observability is important.

Frontend errors are just like 500 errors in your backend; they happen. Monitoring tools like

Sentry

or

LogRocket

help you track:

JS exceptions:

errors that happen in your JavaScript code while the app is running.

Performance bottlenecks:

parts of your app that slow it down or make it lag.

User interactions leading to errors:

actions by users that trigger bugs or crashes in your app.

These tools add a small script to your app. When something breaks, it collects information like the error message, what the user was doing, and browser details. Then it sends that data to the tool’s server, where you can see and fix the issue from your dashboard.

Why it matters:

Detects and resolves issues faster.

Keeps your app stable and performant.

Improves the overall user experience and trust.

Use case:

Used in production apps with real users. SaaS teams track errors right after deployment, e-commerce sites watch checkout issues, and session replay tools help support teams see what confused users without extra bug reports.

Conclusion

Frontend system design is basically backend system design, just happening in the user’s browser.

Every choice you make, like rendering method, caching strategy, state management, architecture, and security, affects speed, scalability, and reliability.

So next time you’re building a frontend, ask yourself:

Where should computation happen?

On the server, in the client’s browser, or at the edge?

When does the data need to be up-to-date?

Prebuilt, cached, or real-time?

How can we keep the app fast and reliable?

Lazy loading, smart caching, or micro frontends?

How do we scale this?

Can the architecture handle 10x traffic? 100x?

How do we maintain this?

Will new developers understand the architecture? Can teams work independently?

Think of your frontend as a distributed system. Treat it that way, and your users will get an app that’s fast, smooth, and seamless, exactly what they expect.

https://www.generalist.com/p/steve-case,Bubble Memory: A CEO’s Reflections on the Dotcom Boom and Bust,Steve Case’s lessons for founders building in the AI gold rush.,2026-01-04T04:08:30.122413,Mario Gabriele,"Illustration by Eleanor Taylor

Friends,

Perhaps no one experienced the dotcom boom and bust quite as viscerally as Steve Case. The founder of Revolution began the decade as an executive at a small software company called Quantum Link, and ended it as the CEO of a behemoth: AOL.

It is hard to overstate just how important a company AOL was at the start of the millennium. Unless you were already of working age and minded towards tech and business, there’s a good chance you haven’t calibrated its size appropriately. AOL was a giant. Between its IPO in 1992 and the start of the new millennium, its stock appreciated approximately

80,000%

, reaching a peak of $222 billion in December 1999. By that point, it had eclipsed many of the business world’s biggest companies, surpassing Disney, IBM, McDonald’s, and Berkshire Hathaway. At the time, AOL was larger than Boeing and General Motors

combined

.

It was also wildly significant and influential, responsible for opening the internet up to a new generation of users and making it fun to use. The AOL of that era pioneered many of the user experiences and behaviors that make up the modern web, from screen names to instant messaging.

In January 2000, AOL looked set for another decade of dominance. On the tenth of that month, it announced a planned merger with Time Warner. Remarkably, AOL was the senior partner, receiving 55% of the combined $350 billion entity. Again, the scale of the deal is hard to comprehend unless you lived it. At the headline valuation, AOL Time Warner became the fourth largest company on the planet – a figure

greater

than “the output of Russia or the Netherlands.”

What came after is the subject of much study and coverage. The market crashed, the merger failed, and not long after, Case stepped down as AOL CEO. By 2005, Case publicly argued in favor of the two companies splitting, and at the end of the decade, that came to fruition. Though there were strong strategic merits to an AOL-Time Warner union, it proved to be a marriage that suited neither party.

It seems as if we are in yet another torrid cycle and potentially one of greater magnitude than that which Case surfed. A recent analyst report argued that the current AI bubble is 17x greater than its dotcom corollary, and 4x larger than the 2008 financial crisis. (We can hope it will be more

productive

than the financial crash, at least.)

A bubble is a strange environment in which to live. It is an even stranger one in which to build a business. How do you keep your feet on the ground when the world beneath is rushing past at a thousand miles an hour? How can you hold fast to reality when wide-eyed investors, gasping for breath, paint ever more fantastical futures in front of you and shove your pockets full of cash? Where is the boundary? Is there really such a thing as a horizon?

We believe that “this time is different,” and there is truth in that. We do not live in a perfectly iterated game. The board has changed, fresh players have stepped onto it, and new moves are always being invented. But it is more naive to pretend the past has nothing to teach us. In fundamental ways, today’s founders face the same set of challenges as their late 90s forerunners. How do you build a team at warp speed? Is it possible to scale a culture when you’re growing exponentially? How can you make smart acquisitions and avoid the most common missteps? What role should partnerships and business development play when you’re forging a new category?

As I thought about these questions, I realized that perhaps no one is better suited to speak from experience than Steve Case himself. And so, I asked him to reflect on his journey at AOL, the similarities and differences between that era and ours, and the lessons founders should heed. We also discuss what it was like to compete head-to-head against Bill Gates, the strategic necessity that drove the Time Warner deal, and the similarities between Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs.

An Interview with Steve Case

To start, I’d love to connect the two eras we’re talking about and the lessons we might take from them. How much does the current AI wave remind you of the dotcom bubble?

It has some similarities, but some differences, too.

Like the internet, AI has been many years in the making. When you look at AI, some of the core technologies can be traced back to something like 70 years ago. This is not a new idea. It just took that time for it to become a mainstream consumer phenomenon. Obviously, over the last ten to twenty years, a lot of companies have integrated AI. Most of the apps we use on our phones rely on AI to some extent. The difference is that nobody called it AI. But it was driving recommendation engines and so on; it was just more of a back-end, invisible thing. It only became an in-your-face visible technology with the success of ChatGPT.

That timing dynamic reminds me of the dotcom era. The gold rush mentality does too. People feel that this is the next big thing, and they don’t want to miss out, which leads to investors pouring a lot of money into companies. A few of those will be wildly successful, many will be OK, and a good number will also probably end up hitting the wall and going out of business, which is what happened with the internet.

Clearly, AI as a core technology and platform is going to have a comparable or greater impact to the internet. It has the ability to transform industries and society in very fundamental ways, but there will be a mix of successes and failures.

A final point I’d make is about government and policy. What most people don’t appreciate about the internet is that the United States wouldn’t have been the leader it was with respect to that technology were it not for a series of government decisions: first, you have the government’s decision to fund the Defense Department’s ARPANET, which basically became the internet. Next, there was the Justice Department’s decision in 1984 to break up AT&T into seven regional operating companies, which drove communication costs down and made the internet much more affordable. Third, there was the decision by the FCC to mandate open access for the telephone networks so that they

had

to let AOL and others plug into them. And, finally, in the early 90s, Congress passed a law opening up the internet to consumers and businesses. Up until that point, it had been restricted to government agencies and educational institutions.

It’s easy to forget these things, but if they hadn’t happened, the internet would not have evolved the way it did. In the case of AI, it’s really important that we figure out what that policy overlay should be. How do you make sure that while the technology is being developed, you don’t over-regulate and stifle innovation? Europe has historically made the mistake of focusing too much on what might go wrong and, as a result, stifles what might go right.

At the same time, though, because AI is so ubiquitous already (versus the internet, which grew slowly before mass adoption), some engagement, some policy guardrails are necessary now.

What might some common-sense guidelines look like?

One of the lessons from the internet is that you need to mandate open access. When it comes to AI, I think we need to make sure the big platform companies are essentially required to have open access. We don’t want to create a system that just allows the big companies to dominate; we have to force them to open their networks and keep them open for new companies to participate and innovate.

You had the rare experience of building what was considered the most significant company of its time during a historic bull market. It remains to be seen to what extent AI is a bubble, but I suspect the lessons you learned building AOL during the dotcom boom are deeply relevant for today’s founders.

As a jumping-off point, how did you manage your mental game during that period? AOL went from a relatively small company to one of the most important on the planet in a short period of time. The company must have been changing noticeably almost every day.

Part of my job was to be a shock absorber for the rest of the company. As the CEO, you have to even out the highs and lows for people. When things are going great, remind them about the risk. I used to call that “delegating paranoia.” When things are down in the dumps, remind them of why you have a bright future. There were plenty of moments like that at AOL – we’d be on the cover of a magazine with the headline saying “AOL is going to go under for XYZ reason.” It’s your role to provide that balance so that people can focus on the overall mission.

It probably helped that it took more than a decade for us to get real traction. I joke that AOL was a ten-year-in-the-making overnight success. The time it took us probably gave all of us, including me, more perspective and humility when all of a sudden it was this go-go-go momentum. It helped me not buy into all the positives or all the negatives.

Beyond that, you have to surround yourself with good advisors, including board members. They were helpful in making sure we were taking a step back at the right times and not just focusing on the day-to-day so much that we missed something. You have to learn to look at the company not just as a snapshot but as a movie that’s playing out.

I imagine that one of the biggest challenges of scaling that fast is finding enough great people who understand what you’re building, and creating the right structure to get the best out of them. Although AI founders today can probably get more leverage on people than during the 1990s, great talent is still essential.

What was your approach to recruiting and organizing talent, and how did it evolve with the business?

Well, it definitely evolved. In the early days, when we were just a couple dozen people, it was about surrounding ourselves with true believers. This was before people knew what the internet was, so there weren’t that many people interested in it. We were looking for people who wanted to be a part of the journey and could add value to it.

When headcount got into the hundreds, we started to be a bit more precise in terms of the roles we needed. You start to run searches for roles and look in a more structured, disciplined way.

When we got into the thousands, and things really started accelerating, I realized that as the CEO, I couldn’t be involved in everything. And so I needed to shift my mindset to spend the majority of my time on recruiting. It might not have been 50% of my actual hours, but it was more than 50% of my

attention

.

A lot of my job in those days was not just promoting AOL but evangelizing the internet. I’d travel a lot and speak at a lot of conferences – Allen&Co in Sun Valley and others. I always had my radar on: Who’s going to be there? Are there people who might be partners in a way that works for us and works for them? Is there anyone I’m really impressed with that I can convince to leave what they’re doing and join us?

Every meeting I was in, every conference I was attending – whatever it was that I was doing – looking for great people was always on my agenda. With the right people and the right focus, anything is possible.

You mentioned that as the company scaled, you felt you couldn’t do everything anymore. The pendulum in tech seems to have swung towards CEOs feeling like they should micro-manage more and have their hands on every part of the business. Why did that feel like the wrong fit for you?",https://www.generalist.com

“Every single good thing happened in my life on the back of some disappointment or failure. Those rejections became rocket fuel.”

— Aydin Senkut

Thank you to our sponsor,

: The AI source of truth for work.

Two decades ago,

Aydin Senkut

was a first-time fund manager with a thin track record to show prospective backers. LPs didn’t believe a solo GP, especially one without experience at a legacy firm, could build a lasting franchise.

They were wrong. Today, Felicis is a Silicon Valley mainstay on its 10th fund, a $900M vehicle. Across its history, Felicis has backed a slew of winners, including Shopify, Canva, Crusoe, and dozens of other billion-dollar outcomes. Rather than specialize over time, Aydin has remained

a

true generalist, investing across markets and cycles. In this conversation, we dig into the frameworks, stories, and philosophies that shaped Felicis into what it is — and where Aydin believes the next decade of technology is heading.

We explore:

How growing up in Turkey with entrepreneur parents shaped Aydin’s approach to risk and investing

Lessons from working alongside Larry Page and Sergey Brin during Google’s early days

Why Felicis deliberately chose a generalist strategy when most VCs were specializing

How international experience became a competitive advantage in finding global winners

The mathematical case for portfolio diversification (50-70 companies per fund)

Why valuation concerns are often overblown when revenue growth is exponential

Felicis’s aggressive AI investment strategy and what other investors are missing

The future of robotics and physical AI through companies like Skild AI

Why learning and adapting rapidly is Felicis’s constitutional principle

https://www.generalist.com/p/54-books-to-read-in-2026,54 Books to Read In 2026,Essential recommendations from some of the world’s most interesting and accomplished people.,2026-01-04T04:08:34.188975,Mario Gabriele,"Friends,

This is one of my favorite questions to ask:

If you had the power to assign a book for everyone on Earth to read and understand, what would you choose?

Long-time supporters of The Generalist will know it’s my preferred way to wrap up a Modern Meditations interview or a podcast episode. So, why do I like it so much? Isn’t it just a convoluted way of asking “What’s your favorite book?”

Not quite. (Though that is a pretty great question too, no matter how staid.) There is, I find, something useful about framing the prompt in this way, and asking people not just what books they

liked

but those they considered deeply important. Plenty of authors can grant us pleasure, but which ones created works that truly merited the world’s attention?

It also opens up the possibility for all kinds of enjoyable subplots. Will someone indulge in the hypothetical chance to promote their own work, thereby locking in a casual 8 billion in new book sales? How might they tilt humanity toward their philosophical or aesthetic preferences? Does it seem utterly unanswerable to them, given the swarm of wonderful books the world contains? Will they reject the premise outright, as a mini-autocracy dressed up as a parlor game? Each of these answers says something, I think, about the way a person reasons.

Over the years, this question has been the source of much joy, intrigue, alpha, and wisdom to me. And so, as we near the end of this year, I took the time to compile every recommendation we’ve received across The Generalist’s written and audio interviews into a single guide, lightly edited for readability. Since it contains no recommendations or musings of my own, I feel I can say with a straight face that it is quite a wonderful document, containing the preferred reads of an eclectic but stunningly accomplished group of people. MacArthur “genius” grantees mingle with multiple Midas List winners, prominent ethical philosophers, legendary entrepreneurs, and extreme biohackers. People who have built new cities sit alongside complexity scientists, a stone’s throw from a computer science legend and former professional poker player. So read on to discover what Alan Kay, Tyler Cowen, Reid Hoffman, David Krakauer, Laura Deming, Bryan Johnson, Katherine Boyle, and others think the world should read.

As you consider how you want to spend your time in 2026, I hope this collection might provide inspiration and open some new avenues for your curiosity to explore.

The “best fund you’ve never heard of” is hiring

Two years ago, The Generalist published its case study on

Hummingbird

. It was the story of a fund that had studiously avoided publicity, while putting together one of the most impressive track records in the asset class, all by focusing obsessively on finding the top 0.1% of founders. It became our most popular piece at the time.

As I shared with readers earlier this year, I became so intrigued by Hummingbird’s psychological approach that I took on a venture partner role. In part, I saw it as a chance to continue studying how the most interesting fund I’d come across functioned from the inside. How

exactly

did they interact with founders? What questions did they ask? Why? What traits did they look for at an even more granular level?

Since spending more time with the team in this capacity, I’ve been struck by just how deep Hummingbird’s craft goes. (Hopefully, I can share some of these discoveries in a future piece.)

For now, though, an opportunity: Hummingbird opened the application for its analyst program a few weeks ago. It’s exactly the kind of role I would have wanted to discover earlier in my venture career and, based on my experience, a rare one. If you’re interested in learning a differentiated investing lens at one of the best-performing funds in the world,

you can apply here

.

As you can probably tell from the above, I think it’s a rather good opportunity. Now, onto the piece.

54 Books to Read In 2026

Reid Hoffman, Greylock

If this is a one-shot opportunity, then I’d probably want to pick a book that has a proven track record for timelessness and universality – in other words, something that I believe could make a lasting impact on the greatest number of readers.

So I think I’d choose Viktor Frankl’s account of his life in a Nazi concentration camp,

Man’s Search for Meaning

.

Originally published in 1946, it’s a book that readers continue to find relevant, decade after decade, because of its emphasis on how, even in circumstances of unimaginable suffering and inhumanity, where despair is a perfectly rational response, we can still find ways to be resilient and resourceful. The key is to maintain hope for the future and a sense of purpose that goes beyond the alleviation of our own suffering and is instead enmeshed in the human connections and relationships that give our lives meaning.

Roelof Botha, Sequoia Capital

The book I hand out to people is

Man’s Search for Meaning

by Viktor Frankl. Frankl was a Holocaust survivor, and the book doesn’t detail the horrors of what he endured, but it talks about the insight he had into human nature.

There are competing views of what motivates us. There’s the hedonistic view that we pursue pleasure. Then there’s Adler, who thought we pursue power, and that’s where we derive value and meaning in our lives. Frankl developed logotherapy based on the belief that purpose is what drives us. That purpose could be a mission, a family member, or a pursuit. But there’s

something

that keeps us going.

Frankl had this insight before he went into the concentration camps, but it was honed by his experience there. He saw, for example, that the death rate in the camp increased around Christmas and the New Year. Not that any of the captives were Christian, but it was a remembrance of time with family. People lost hope during those windows and basically gave up on life because they had no reason to live anymore. Frankl has this phrase, “Someone who has a ‘why’ will bear almost any ‘how.’”

When we think about our own personal life experiences, I think we need to understand meaning. Because money is not going to bring you happiness. It buys luxuries, but it’s not going to bring you happiness. I think it’s very important for people to define their personal happiness.

When it comes to building a company, mission-driven companies just do better. You can’t staple a mission onto a company if it’s inauthentic. It has to be truly authentic. Natera is a good example. It started with the CEO wanting to help people have healthy babies, and though it’s expanded, it remains such a mission-driven company. That mission defines the kind of decisions they make inside the company and gives people comfort when they’re pulling all-nighters or doing incredibly hard work to remember the purpose they’re serving.

Claire Hughes Johnson, Stripe

To the Lighthouse

is an iconic novel. On one level, it’s about a family, but it’s about much more than that. It’s about death, existence, the human condition – and how we can be so close to someone without really knowing them.

From a formal perspective, Woolf immerses you in her characters’ innermost thoughts without using much dialogue and creates a dreamlike state. From the reader’s perspective, you’re surfing different perspectives, different inner monologues, and the passage of time. Nearly a hundred years after it was published, it’s a work that still feels innovative and disruptive.

Chris Miller, Author of

Chip War

I really admire Dan Yergin’s

The Prize

.

It’s a history of the last two hundred years through the lens of the most important industry of that period: oil. It’s got it all: the personalities, business, geology, politics, and wars that defined that period. I think you could do no better in understanding why the world is structured the way it is than by reading that one book.

Rebecca Kaden, Union Square Ventures

I’d choose

Pale Fire

by Vladimir Nabokov. It’s a wild, unusual book by an unusual person and author. It’s structured as a fictional 999-line poem and then a fictional line-by-line annotation of it. It requires a lot of choices at every turn – including how to read it (the poem and then the annotation? Flipping back and forth?). So it makes you work for it. But at heart, it’s an incredible work about the relevance of stories, how thin the line is between our reality and the narratives we tell ourselves, and the importance of those narratives for sustenance. It’s also about imagination and creation, and that whole worlds can be created by powerful ideas. It asks the reader to constantly figure out what is real and what is not, or to give up and accept the uncomfortable state of not knowing, thereby embracing the story. I love reading across genres, but nothing deepens my thinking and takes my mind to new places like great works of fiction.

Toby Ord, Oxford University

Practical Ethics

by Peter Singer is a really good, no-nonsense approach to thinking about ethics. It really helps show you how to reason about all kinds of issues with an open mind, without assuming that our current ethical intuitions are the be-all and end-all.

In that vein, Derek Parfitt mentions that there’s really only been a couple of generations in which people have made what he calls “non-religious ethics” their life’s work. If you look at the whole history of philosophy, almost all ethical discussions occurred within a religious context where the set of possible answers had to align with what had been thought thousands of years earlier. There had really only been a couple of exceptions. And only a short period of time since that kind of inquiry became more widespread. Parfitt saw that as a reason to be optimistic about the possibility of making substantial moral progress.

Sara Seager, MIT

I would choose

The Giver

.

It’s required middle school reading in parts of America. That’s actually how I came across it: discovering it when my kids were in school. It’s absolutely astonishing. You’re reading this book set in what is supposed to be a utopia. But partway through, there’s a crack in the facade.

I feel like we’re all living in a bubble of this kind, and every once in a while, there’s a crack. It’s our job to look through the crack and figure out what it means for us and those around us.

Martin Casado, a16z

I’d pick

The Weirdest People in the World

by Joseph Henrich. It basically says that the Protestant Revolution changed the way we associated ourselves and each other. We used to be very, very tribal, which impacts trust. The Protestant Revolution forced nuclear families and separation, and those shifts required us to be pro-social.

It has a second thesis on how free markets produce pro-social behavior. The reason I’d choose it is that if you look at the long arc of humanity, the ultimate enemy is entropy. That never goes away, and I don’t think any single tribe solves that. So you need pro-social behavior to actually undertake planetary-level innovation, and to do that, we need to understand how we operate when it comes to trust, coordination, and cooperation.

Beyond that, I’d mention David Deutsch’s

The

Beginning of Infinity

,

Taleb’s

Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails

, Hamming’s

The Art of Doing Science and Engineering

,

Fukuyama’s

The End of History and the Last Man

.

Fukuyama has since recanted on the view in the book, but it’s this Hegelian take on humanity, the conclusion of which is that liberal democracy is the end of history. I think that’s being questioned right now, but Fukuyama does such a great job of outlining the Hegelian perspective and showing there is this evolution of humans, and we are continuing to get better. Fukuyama thought that maybe we’d arrived; the conclusion now is that we haven’t. But I love the idea that, as a species, we’re improving how we interact, how we make policies, and how we socialize.",https://www.generalist.com

Prediction markets are no longer a fringe curiosity. They are becoming one of the most revealing instruments in modern finance. Platforms like Polymarket, once a niche corner of crypto, now regularly clear billions in monthly volume as traders speculate on everything from political outcomes to sports to cultural events. Few people saw this future as early, or as clearly, as Joey Krug.

A decade before prediction markets went mainstream, Joey dropped out of college to co-found Augur, the first decentralized prediction market protocol. He later became one of the most influential investors in the category by backing Polymarket at Founders Fund. In this conversation, Joey shares why the moment for prediction markets has finally arrived, what has changed, and how these markets are reshaping information flows across society.

We explore:

The experimental mindset that led Joey from horse-racing predictions to mining bitcoin in high school

Why Augur was the right idea at the wrong moment, and what it taught Joey about timing and infrastructure

The product, liquidity, and founder-market fit signals that persuaded Founders Fund to back Polymarket

Why resolution is the hardest problem in prediction markets, and how Polymarket approaches it

How crypto treasury companies are emerging as a major force and where ETFs fit in

Why mimetic behavior drives entire sectors and how savvy investors read those waves

The rise and fall of Operation Choke Point and its impact on crypto

How Founders Fund reframed Joey’s approach to evaluating founders, markets, and structural shifts

https://www.generalist.com/p/mike-maples-2,Where have the heretics gone?,"In our latest letter, Mike Maples Jr. and I explore what apostasy means in the age of AI.",2026-01-04T04:08:37.335090,Mario Gabriele,"Illustration by Eleanor Taylor

Friends,

Where have the heretics gone?

There is a feeling in the venture landscape at the moment of intense, ferocious orthodoxy. Everyone agrees that AI is a significant technology. The question of its impact is only one of degree. Does it count as heresy to simply pay more for the same company everyone agrees is compelling? Equally, is there any originality in sniffing that prices are too high?

AI is not the only example. To a lesser extent, the same can be said of sectors once considered untouchable. With the exception of contrarians like Founders Fund, VCs of the 2010s balked at backing defense and industrial companies. Now, they are in fashion. The result is that the space for heresy has shrunk.

Of course, this is very good news, for it is usually in periods of fervid homogeneity that a new paradigm emerges. Only when everything looks dull and solved is it possible for an idea to emerge and flip the perspective.

Floodgate founder Mike Maples, Jr. has made a career out of finding unlikely ideas, primed for major impact. More than many other VCs, he has made a concerted effort to uncover what it takes for an idea to be truly “different.” And so, in this edition of “Letters to a Young Investor,” I asked for his thoughts on what constitutes a true heresy and where investors might find them in the age of AI.

You’ll find an honest appraisal of the difficulty of thinking differently and what it takes to translate that into investing decisions.

What you’ll learn:

The three ingredients of heresy

. Heresy isn’t just about inverting the consensus position. To find a truly heretical idea, Mike argues that a founder needs to have gone through (i) a different life experience that allows them to (ii) see something others don’t, and then must (iii) have the courage to act on it.

Using AI to solve a problem

. Many of the companies gaining attention in AI are using the technology for its own sake, not to solve a real problem. Mike is increasingly excited by founders from the material sciences and drug discovery spaces that have been able to leverage modern AI to solve problems they’ve thought about for years.

Finding “new scarcities.”

Every new technology creates a new scarcity. As Mike explains, when computation became cheap, software became scarce, given how important and useful it had suddenly become. Similarly, AI has commoditized some forms of cognition while others remain unsolved.

Investing in the “capability cycle.

” Rather than trying to time the hype cycle, Mike recommends focusing on how the underlying capabilities are progressing. Then, find the entrepreneurs who have waited their whole careers to build something that new capability unlocks.

Recognizing heresy

. It is difficult to summon heretical ideas unbidden. However, Mike has learned to recognize it when he sees it, noticing the mix of excitement and discomfort such ideas tend to produce.

As a refresher, “Letters to a Young Investor” is a series designed to give readers like you an intimate look at the strategies, insights, and wisdom of the world’s best investors. We do that via a back-and-forth correspondence that we publish in full – giving you a chance to peek into the inbox of legendary venture capitalists. Here’s a selection of previous correspondences:

Mike,

The English writer Graham Greene addressed the matter well: “Heresy is another word for freedom of thought.” Greene spoke from experience. His novel The Power and the Glory, chronicling the struggles of a Mexican “whisky priest,” was viewed as so heterodox by the Catholic Church that it considered issuing a blanket ban.

In a previous conversation, you mentioned the topic of “heresy” and its role in the context of startups. That immediately intrigued me. It is, after all, an emotive, laden word. Reading your

last letter

, I began to see how it might fit into your model of investing. This notion seemed to be embedded in your recollections of Airbnb, Figma, Twitter, Applied Intuition, and Twitch; that a kind of profound dissidence is not merely intriguing, but required for a truly outlier outcome.

In one sense, venture investors have articulated a version of this wisdom for some time. A good student of startups now knows that it is not enough to be right – you must be contrarian and right. If your company advances a consensus view of the world, even in success, it will struggle to make a big enough impact. But from your work, it’s clear that you think about heresy at a deeper level, taking inspiration from historical figures like Galileo. I’d be keen to hear what this word means to you as an investor, and what distinguishes authentic heresy from mere originality.

More concretely, I’d be interested in hearing how you think about heresy in the context of AI. On the one hand, the AI world remains roiled by disagreements. Deeply felt philosophical differences animate pockets of the industry. On one end of the spectrum are accelerationists who believe human flourishing and national competitiveness require us to hit the gas; on the other end are “doomers” who believe the end is nigh. In the middle sit a wide range of builders and researchers who see both real risk and immense possibility.

While this debate plays a critical role in the zeitgeist, it doesn’t especially seem to perturb the direction of capital allocation. Seemingly without exception, venture investors are keen to invest in the current wave, even as technological breakthroughs appear to slow and valuations inflate. A grand financial consensus has appeared to form in the private markets, with the only real discussion being the degree to which AI will change everything.

Over the past six months in particular, this seems to have created a culture of orthodoxy and replication. Every few days, we see a new prompt-to-code product or browser agent released. Each week, an “AI for X” vertical takes the stage. Nearly all seem to receive backing from credible investors ready to believe that this one, this umpteenth iteration, will be the winner. (From stage right, Peter Thiel shouts “mimesis!”) Some of these startups will undoubtedly work, and a sparse few may succeed outlandishly. But when creative homogeneity seems to have taken so firm a hold, where is the space for heresy? Amid glossy uniformity, what does “different” look like today?

As you know better than I do, true heresy is not merely the repudiation of the old model. There is little value in simply declaring AI to be moribund. The real breakthrough will come from introducing a new paradigm; by arriving orthogonally, carrying a strange truth. Where might this come from? It is usually not the job of investors to come up with heresies, but the best tend to be gifted at knowing where it might originate. What dynamics are you heeding? As greater sums are ploughed into escalating an existing paradigm, where have you started directing your attention?

It is a kind of market parlor game to compare eras. But given that you lived through the dotcom boom and bust as an entrepreneur, I wonder what rhymes with that era you hear today. Does this remind you of the late-90s or do the comparisons obscure rather than reveal?

More tactically, how have you sought to play the AI revolution at Floodgate? What is the kind of risk you’ve been happiest buying? You’ve written about the importance of timing in startup success. How much do you think about timing technological cycles as you deploy capital? Is it useful to have a sense of this in your head, or does the game return, unerringly, to listening and paying attention to special people when you come across them, regardless of the market’s machinations?

With gratitude,

Mario

Dear Mario,

Your letter about heresy arrived at a weird moment for me. Or, maybe it’s not weird at all. Maybe you chose these questions because all of us are in a weird moment.

I’ve been sitting with your Graham Greene quote and your questions for more than two weeks now. (Sorry about that.) One reason is that something keeps bothering me: If heresy is freedom of thought, then do I actually have any heresies left in me?

Or, do I just have a bunch of sophisticated-sounding opinions that I’ve convinced myself are heresies because they buy me status at dinner parties and keynote pitches?

I keep feeling that there’s a bigger question behind your questions. Am I, or the broader VC industrial complex I’m part of, actually spotting genuine heresy anymore? Is it possible that “seeming contrarian” has become the new orthodoxy?

The honest answer is that I don’t know.

And that’s scary to say because they tell me my job is to spot non-consensus futures. Let me see if I can work through this honestly, including the parts where I’m confused.

What heresy actually is

Here’s how I think about it: Contrarians say everyone thinks A, so I’ll say B. That’s still playing the same game, and just taking the opposite position. Heretics are saying something different. They’re saying the whole A/B way of thinking about the problem is broken. Usually it’s because they’ve seen an anomaly that the old pattern can’t explain.

With Airbnb, Brian, Joe, and Nate didn’t start by thinking about hospitality. They were broke friends trying to pay next month’s rent. Renting their apartment to strangers seemed like an easy way to make fast money. But when they offered their apartment to guests, they noticed something surprising: if you make staying with strangers feel meaningfully human, people will choose it. That insight didn’t fit any existing pattern.

This is what I’m trying to figure out: is heresy a

cognitive difference

(seeing something others don’t see) or a

courage difference

(acting on something others won’t act on) or a

life experience difference

(seeing something because you experienced something a whole bunch of other people are about to see?)

And actually (this is where I think I’ve been wrong) maybe genuine heresy requires

all three

. You need the perceptual difference to notice something meaningful, the relevant experience to know when that perception matters, and the courage to act on it. Which might explain why heresy is so rare.

You can see all three in the Airbnb story: You notice what others overlook. You act before anyone else believes or cares. Your life circumstances exposed you to this truth first.

What’s happening right now

There’s far less room for heretical insight in AI than most people admit. Most debates, like big vs. small models, open vs. closed source, and agents vs. assistants, are just different moves inside the same game. If history rhymes, the real opportunities will emerge from somewhere surprising, from a place or anomaly everyone has dismissed.

Something else is happening too. The founders raising money aren’t necessarily the ones who’ve noticed something true about the world. They’re the ones who can tell a good story about platform shifts and timing. That part sounds like 1999 all over again.

Here’s the scary part: a well-told story can sound exactly like an insight. It has the same structure and words. But real insight comes from noticing something specific about reality. Story increasingly comes from noticing what gets funded.",https://www.generalist.com

In the summer of 2022, Parth Garg woke up in Bangalore to discover that his co-founder had fled the country and emailed their investors to tell them their company was dead. Just over three years later, Aspora is one of fintech’s fastest-growing startups. The company, which makes it faster and cheaper for India’s diaspora to send money home and access banking services, now processes close to half a billion dollars in volume every month and has earned a $500 million valuation with backing from elite investors like Hummingbird Ventures, Sequoia, and Greylock.

In this conversation, Parth shares his journey from physics prodigy to fintech founder, offering insights into what it really takes to build resilience as a founder and how to create a culture where feedback flows freely, even without a co-founder to provide checks and balances.

We explore:

The moment when Parth discovered his co-founder had left the country and told investors the company was shutting down

How Parth’s childhood moving between cities in India and later to the UAE shaped his adaptability and entrepreneurial mindset

His journey from physics prodigy to startup founder, including early ventures before Aspora

The process of discovering product-market fit through structured experimentation after the initial business model failed

Why the Indian diaspora represents a massive, underserved financial opportunity (1% of the population contributing 30% of deposits)

How stablecoins dramatically reduced Aspora’s working capital requirements and transformed their business model

The regulatory landscape for fintech and crypto in India and the impact of the GENIUS Act in the US

Aspora’s vision to become a comprehensive cross-border bank serving multiple diaspora communities globally

What if you could redesign the rules of society? Not tweak the margins, but start over entirely. That’s the question driving Erick Brimen, founder and CEO of Próspera, a private charter city in Roatán, Honduras. Próspera is a radical experiment in governance: a platform that lets governments and entrepreneurs build cities with new legal systems, regulatory frameworks, and institutions from the ground up. Brimen believes that

governance itself

can be innovated upon. That cities, like software, can be upgraded. His goal isn’t just to build one new jurisdiction, but to create an operating system for hundreds of prosperous, self-governing communities around the world. In this conversation, Erick and I explore what it really takes to build a modern Singapore from scratch — and why better governance might be humanity’s most powerful lever for progress.

Together we explore:

How Brimen’s childhood in Venezuela shaped his understanding of governance and poverty

The historical precedents for charter cities like Dubai, Singapore, and Hong Kong

Why common law, trusted dispute resolution, and dynamic governance are essential foundations

How Próspera’s Governance-as-a-Service model aligns incentives between governments, operators, and residents

The current state of Próspera in Honduras, including its three hubs and economic impact

The political challenges Próspera has faced and how international arbitration has protected the project

Why regulatory innovation enables industries like biotech, crypto, and advanced manufacturing to flourish

How the model could be applied to “catch-up growth,” industry diversification, and accelerating growth in developed nations

The vision for a modern Hanseatic League of charter cities operating on shared governance principles

Friends,

There is a certain category of article that I find difficult to name, but which I always enjoy reading. We might call it a collection of musings, a set of opinions, a list of miscellaneous observations. Alex Guzey calls his version “

Lifehacks

,” Laura Deming refers to hers as “

mental models

,” and Nat Friedman prefaces his as “

some things I believe

.”

Each offers a numbered list of thoughts. Some are simple, others deceptively profound. Part of what is enjoyable about these lists is that the things I find simple, you are likely to find profound, and vice versa. Equally, those that I enthusiastically endorse, you may consider absurd.

Whatever one’s take on the individual insights, as a whole, they represent efficient distillations of someone’s mind. Read them and you feel as if you know the person a little better; as if you have gotten a tour of their inner landscape. More importantly, you start to see your own mind reflected.

Today, I’m sharing my version. It is a collection of observations that are true to me. I would be surprised if, in ten years’ time, I don’t disagree with myself, but for the moment, it is an authentic distillation of my mind. My hope is that it sparks some interesting reflections for you and perhaps introduces some new lenses through which you view your work, goals, and interactions.

If you have one truly good idea in your life, that is more than enough.

To improve your mind, read fiction. We spend the vast majority of our professional lives in pure knowledge-gathering mode; there are different, deeper truths hidden in stories.

“Never quit” is terrible advice. Try lots of things, quit lots of things. Your time is not infinite. Sometimes you have to give up an old dream for a better one to emerge.

It’s more impactful to know your most talented contemporaries than your heroes. Meeting a hero is unlikely to change the course of your life. But if you meet the most talented minds of your generation early, you can spend the next fifty years collaborating with them as they scale.

Status transactions

are happening everywhere, all the time. If you’re not attuned to this, you will miss half of what’s happening in a given conversation.

Learning how to ask good questions is a legitimate discipline worth studying. We underestimate how much insight, connection, and alpha are unlocked by the right series of words. Exponents of this art form change the texture of a conversation at any moment.

Resist other people’s attempts to categorize you. They are missing too much context to do so well.

If you want to really remember a book, buy the physical version and read with a pen in your hand.

It is possible to reinvent yourself at any moment. Cultivate a loose attachment to your view of yourself.

Debate is one of the least effective ways of making up your mind on a topic. It is only worthwhile as a theatrical enterprise. (Written debate is better.)

“Where is it written…” Assume that most conventions are arbitrary and illegitimate. Rules are more malleable than we believe.

Imagine “pulling forward” skills from your future self into the present. If you wish you were a better public speaker, imagine the future version of yourself giving that ability to the present version of yourself.

Genius is narrower than we tend to believe. It extrapolates poorly outside a given field, era, or context. A genius pontificating on something outside of their discipline is probably less reliable than a regular person.

Even the best of minds suddenly burn out. (See: Newton, Grothendieck, Fischer.) Before you persuade yourself that there must be some hidden brilliance in a genius’s proclamations, consider this.

Learn keyboard shortcuts; use snippets.

Listening to the audiobook is fine for entertainment, not for retention.

The current founder trend of prioritizing attention above all else misunderstands greatness. No legendary company won through stunts. At some point, you actually have to build something valuable.

It should concern you if you have never failed at something. You should fail badly, relatively often. Otherwise, you are playing it too safe.

The pressure to be “well-informed” has made us more ignorant. Unless you work in one of a small number of professions, there is no value in reading the day’s news. It stales quickly, tends toward the histrionic, and underweights relevant historical context. Much better to scan the headlines every couple of weeks and pick a relevant topic to learn about from higher-quality sources.

We overvalue the freshness of information. Read old books. There is usually a reason they survived.

Amor fati

.

The finest practitioners of a given discipline are often the worst at articulating their craft. Too much of their skill comes from inherent qualities, or abilities illegible even to themselves. Better to watch these people rather than ask them to explain.

Most modern writing advice is copywriting advice. Be careful.

Striving for legibility is overrated. It is much better to adopt a degree of inscrutability. What you lose in definition, you gain in freedom and flexibility.

If someone tells you to pick between two trade-offs (e.g., speed vs. cost), default to rejecting the premise. Sometimes you really do have to make a choice, but you can find a way to have both more frequently than you expect.

You can neutralize most conversational risks by calling them out. (E.g. “I’m being quite direct here…”; “I recognize this is very persistent of me…”)

There is huge alpha in carefully reviewing the source material. (See:

Eli Dourado

.)

Question the assumptions and run the numbers yourself. Everyone assumed it was economically infeasible for a private company to build rockets until Elon

opened his spreadsheet

.

Test out vastly disparate career paths as early as you can. Most people test within an extremely narrow band (e.g., going from banking to consulting to big tech).

If you want to become the best at something, you have to devise a kind of differential training. You cannot achieve something new by adhering to the same path as those before you.

Great things happen at the collision between fields.

The collective opinion on who the “best” is in a given industry is usually spotty or simply wrong. Proximity is often required to assess quality, and the most skilled practitioners may not advertise their approach.

Love is easy. The difference between bad relationships and meeting your spouse is not a matter of degree, but category. Compatibility is unignorable and effortless.

Earning your first $1 on the internet can change your life.

“Art is never finished, only abandoned.”

If you have not changed your mind about something important in the past ten years, you should be concerned.

You cannot have an interesting conversation without an element of risk. One person, or both, must subtly push the boundaries.

Every once in a while, you’re reminded that people perceive the world so differently from you that they may as well be on another planet. This is happening all the time, whether you notice it or not.

Allow yourself to be the dumbest person in the room. You will ask better questions and go to better rooms.

“A Prince who is not himself wise cannot be well advised.”

You become solely responsible for your education once you leave school. You must learn to become your own teacher; most do not.

To make an impact on the world, you must pay a debt to modernity. It is romantic to imagine succeeding just as your heroes once did, but they lived in a different time, in different circumstances. A concession to the present day is necessary.

The same skills that made you a good student may make you a bad employee.

“How you do anything is how you do everything” is a perfect encapsulation of what is not true. Brilliance is context-dependent. Energy is context-dependent. Insight is context-dependent. (See:

Jobs’ pathetic job application

.)

Set yourself a curriculum. What books do you want to read this year? How can you organize them? What gap in your knowledge still bothers you? These questions are your responsibility to answer.

At some point, you must internalize the fact that people will dislike you through no fault of your own, and that it is not your job to change their minds.

“Real artists ship.”

The first time you think you’ve missed the wave, there are probably still a couple of decades left. (See: the internet, crypto, AI.)

Sleeping on an important decision really does help.

Billions of dollars have been invested in making social media platforms addictive. Relying on willpower alone is a lot to ask. Invest in content blockers as you rewire yourself.

Cold Turkey

is a good one.

Learn to respect the process of the unconscious mind, especially in creative matters. Sometimes, you cannot chase the answer; you must wait for it to come to you.

You become the stories you tell yourself about yourself.

Respect your process. If you do your best work at 4 AM with a bowl of candied ginger, do that. Give yourself the latitude to be a difficult artist when necessary.

Simply decide that you are willing to go first. That could be raising your hand to volunteer for something, taking the first leap off the high dive, or responding to a question that leaves an awkward silence. You reduce social anxiety and increase your agency by just defaulting to taking responsibility.",https://www.generalist.com

Often called the godfather of NYC tech, Kevin Ryan is one of America’s most influential entrepreneurs and investors. He co-founded MongoDB, Business Insider, Gilt Groupe, Zola, and Transcend Therapeutics, and continues to build and back new companies each year through AlleyCorp. Earlier in his career, he led DoubleClick from a 20-person startup to a global leader, taking it public before its acquisition by Google.

In this episode, Kevin shares his insights on two surprising pockets of the future that he’s betting on: psychedelics for mental health and AI-powered materials science. He unpacks how psychedelics are showing remarkable success in treating depression and PTSD, and why AI may discover revolutionary new materials, from helicopter blades to smartphone glass, that humans never imagined possible.

We explore:

Friends,

At its core, “

Introduction to Poetry

” by Billy Collins is about the difference between the drive to define something and the drive to understand it. In a few sparse lines, Collins contrasts the way he wishes readers would appreciate poetry with the manner in which so many do so. Rather than appreciating its contours and marveling over its intricacies, most readers prefer to pummel a poem for information. Instead of holding it to the light “like a color slide” or “waterski[ing]” across its surface, they “begin beating it with a hose/to find out what it really means.” In their drive to define the work in front of them – to analyze and probe it – Collins’ readers neglect its beauty, and miss what really makes it tick.

Though Collins is talking about poetry, he could just as well have been describing any craft. No matter the discipline, there is always this tension between defining and understanding, controlling and observing, grasping and witnessing.

When it comes to the craft of venture capital, Mike Maples, Jr. is one of its great appreciators.

Over the past two decades, the Floodgate co-founder has built a remarkable track record by attuning himself to the frequency of great entrepreneurs, observing their quirks, and seeking to understand.

As Mike himself describes it, his praxis is not about thinking faster or exhaustively analyzing a market, but simply

listening differently

.

That approach has allowed Mike to make many outlier investments long before they broke out, backing Twitter, Twitch, Okta, and Applied Intuition in their messy infancies.

As part of The Generalist’s “Letters to a Young Investor” series, we’ll explore the nuances of Mike’s craft. To learn how one of the best early-stage investors of the past twenty years spots the future and identifies anomalies, read on.

VC checks may be shrinking, but ambition is on the rise.

Mercury’s 2025 data report,

The New Economics of Starting Up

, surveyed 1,500 early-stage founders across funding, AI adoption, hiring, and more. For investors, it’s a signal worth watching. Founders aren’t slowing down — they’re rewriting the playbook.

Here’s a preview of what they learned:

Self-funding is the number one avenue for accessing capital — even for tech companies, with half likely to bootstrap.

87% of founders are more optimistic about their financial future than they were last year, despite prevailing uncertainties.

AI isn’t stymying job growth, like headlines would have you assume. 79% of companies surveyed, who have adopted AI, said they’re hiring more because of it.

: Finding pattern breakers

From

: Mario Gabriele

To

: Mike Maples, Jr.

Date

: Tuesday, October 7 2025 at 4:20 PM BST

Mike,

I’m sitting down with a cup of coffee, a stack of notes, and a well-worn copy of

Pattern Breakers

to begin this correspondence with you. It’s one that I’ve been looking forward to for some time, admiring your career for many years. That’s as much to do with the respect with which other investors talk about your work, as the formidable string of winners you’ve backed. You have always struck me as a true venture craftsman, with an unfakeable obsession for startups.

Reading

Pattern Breakers

only makes this sincere fascination more evident. I wish more exceptional investors would take the time to transcribe and distill their insights so thoughtfully. As you know better than I do, so much of early-stage investing relies on intuition and subtle signaling – a reality which often makes it difficult for even great practitioners to articulate their work. That can lead to the impression that venture capital is pure luck. No one can deny chance’s role, but to minimize it to spinning a roulette wheel misses the hazy art that the best have mastered.

Pattern Breakers

is an insightful articulation of your version of the craft. It outlines the lessons you’ve deduced across twenty years of investing and countless hours of further research. It contains many wonderful observations I find myself mulling over regularly. One particular favorite is that great startups force a choice, not a comparison. As you note, Airbnb did not try to build a better version of the Four Seasons, but competed on entirely new terrain. While the Four Seasons promises to deliver a high-quality, consistent experience, Airbnb offers authenticity, giving travelers the chance to “live like a local.” Neither is inherently superior. Rather, they appeal to different customers and sensibilities. I’ve found myself returning to this heuristic repeatedly since I learned it.

To set the stage for our conversation, I’d love to dig into Pattern Breakers more deeply and examine the philosophies animating your investing. Rather than asking you to rehash the book’s major points (which I recommend readers enjoy wholesale), I wondered if we might try to understand its ideas “in action,” so to speak.

To paint a familiar scenario: Imagine a founder has walked into Floodgate’s offices to pitch you for the first time. How do you go about assessing whether you might have a pattern-breaking business on your hands?

I am sincerely interested in this at the most granular possible level. Do you prefer to sit directly across from an entrepreneur or kitty-corner to them? Do you prefer going for a walk to a formal pitch? Does it help you ask better questions to review materials beforehand, or do you want to hear everything fresh? To what extent are you analyzing small clues about their posture, attire, speaking speed, and so on? Are there any initial indicia that excite you? These might sound frivolous to some readers, but I’m increasingly of the opinion that these little details

really

influence the conversation you’re able to have.

We could spend a full other letter on questions alone. Which are among your favorites? (Bezos reportedly loved, “Are you a lucky person?” for example.) Which questions give you signal most frequently? You’ve noted before that you liked to ask, “Is this from the future?” What does that question tell you? How long does it take to realize a business might be truly special? How long do you take to make up your mind? What does your internal process look like to get to conviction? How much still, after all these years, comes down to feel? How much time do you spend analyzing the person versus the idea?

While reading your book, I found myself thinking about the tension between assessing an

idea

and assessing a

person

.

Pattern Breakers

covers both, but at least in my reading, it is primarily interested in the characteristics of game-changing

ideas

. You elegantly outline the importance of a startup building on (1) an “inflection” – some material technological, commercial, or sociological change, and (2) an “insight” around it. Lyft is a good example: Logan Green and John Zimmer recognized that smartphones with GPS were an inflection point, and then had the insight that this might enable a new kind of taxi network.

But you’ve remarked that 80% of your best investments came from pivots. Which makes me wonder: what signal do you get from a startup idea, knowing that it’s liable to change? Is it simply a proxy for a founder’s insightfulness and acuity? Are you using the current canvas to understand how their mind works? Or do you need to sincerely feel as if there’s an inflection and insight at the heart of it?

More broadly, what do you look for in a person? You’ve written about the importance of disagreeableness. Do you try to test for that explicitly? How so? Are there certain patterns you’ve noticed recur across outlier people? What shared alleles might you find if you put Ev Williams, Emmett Shear, Todd McKinnon, and Logan Green under a microscope? I am certain they have more differences than similarities, but equally convinced that there must be some unifying quality.

With much appreciation from one venture “anorak” to another,

Mario

Dear Mario,

I really like your questions, because they get to the messy part of seed investing. It’s not about spreadsheets or pattern-matching. It’s about sensing whether someone is already living in the future and inviting the rest of us to catch up. You’re not just asking about mental models. You’re asking about the

feel.

One of the first times I felt the future, I was in a Palo Alto cafe, and a 23-year-old Justin Kan walked in. He had a webcam strapped to a baseball cap and a mess of wires leading to a backpack. I was already skeptical. And that was

before

he said he planned to livestream his life. All of it. Twenty-four hours a day, like an internet reality TV show. It almost sounded like a prank.

But then he spun his laptop around, and there I was, live on the internet.

Suddenly, it felt different, and my curiosity started to take over. “How did you do that, and what’s in your backpack?” I asked. Justin opened it, and inside was a Linux computer, a video encoder, EVDO cellular hardware, and some Python code held together mostly with duct tape and conviction. But it actually worked, and keep in mind this was in 2007. YouTube had only existed for 18 months. Most people still had flip phones.

The cafe hadn’t changed, but my sense of possibility had. It didn’t feel like a pitch anymore. It felt like stepping through a portal to a different future. He wasn’t selling me. He was already living in a different reality and offering me a fleeting glimpse. And even though there were many pivots and years between Justin.tv and what became Twitch, the basic insight that millions of normal people would want to stream content was right, no matter how heavily disguised it was in the initial idea.

For a long time, I confused being early with being smart. Seeing things first felt like a superpower. But the seed investors that are rewarded most are not the futurists who can predict. They’re the ones who

notice

. Catching radically new futures feels less like investing and more like witnessing.

There are a few small habits I find helpful when I’m trying to catch a pattern-breaking future described by a founder:

Don’t label startups.

The moment you call something “Uber for X,” you lose too much resolution to see what’s truly different about it. Labels turn messy ideas into something that fits into our current understanding, but they make you believe you understand things you don’t. The best startups break the current patterns of our current understanding. When you jump too quickly to a label, you’re more likely to miss the small, magical details that matter most.",https://www.generalist.com

Navin Chaddha has spent three decades at the forefront of innovation—first as a founder, and now as managing partner at Mayfield, one of Silicon Valley’s oldest venture firms. A 17-time member of Forbes’ Midas List, Navin has guided generations of entrepreneurs through waves of technological change, from the dot-com boom to the AI era. At Mayfield, he champions a philosophy rooted in the firm’s founding ethos: investing in people, not markets. That approach has shaped his perspective on what it takes to build enduring companies. In this conversation, Navin shares why $1 trillion in infrastructure spending is fueling a new hardware renaissance, how stealth startups are going from zero to billions in a year, and what it means for the future of innovation.

We explore:

How “vibe coding” is democratizing technology creation through conversational, collaborative, and cognitive interfaces

Why Navin believes the “vibe economy” will transform how we work, live, and play

How Mayfield’s 56-year focus on “backing the jockey, not the racetrack” shapes its investment approach

The massive opportunity in AI hardware infrastructure

How stealth AI hardware startups are going from zero to billions in under a year

How India’s tech ecosystem has evolved and where the real opportunities are today

This year, I published 46 posts and 15 interviews, covering a range of issues in the finance sector. AI was a big theme as it latched onto capital markets for a growing share of its funding. Private markets attracted a lot of attention, too, as they continued their expansion across both equity and credit. And retail investors remained in the spotlight, buying the dip in April and embracing new innovations to increase their influence over markets.

The five most-viewed posts on

When I wrote this in January, analysts projected that the five big hyperscalers – Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Oracle – would spend $288 billion on capital expenditure in 2025. By year end, the number is over $400 billion. With much of it channeled to data centers, I took an early look at what (and who) is financing the boom.

Catch Me If You Can

“Europe has a real problem,” said Jamie Dimon this month. It hasn’t stopped European markets from giving chase to the S&P 500. This post from January builds the case. Bookended by

a piece

in December which looks at European banks’ outperformance, it remains useful reading for investors struggling with how much to allocate to Europe in 2026.

Bubble Trouble

It was difficult to escape bubble talk as the year progressed. My contribution to the debate lay in three posts:

October Throwbacks

. In 2024, non-bank financial institutions grew assets by 9.4% – double the pace of the banking sector – to increase their share of total global financial assets to 51% ($257 trillion). Feels a bit like 1907?

Bubble Trouble

.

Public market valuations are not as stretched as they were in 2000, but some private market valuations may be. No company in modern history is projected to burn as much cash before turning a profit as OpenAI.

Bubble Trouble 2

. The launch of the ABX subprime index in January 2006 created a coordination point for the unwind that followed. Silicon Data’s H100 Rental Index is worth keeping an eye on.

Retail Resurgence

Retail investors are closing the gap on institutions, making up close to 21% of US equity trading volume, versus 30% among institutional buy-side firms. Some consequences:

Robinhood’s Smile

. Best performing stock in the MSCI World Financial Index two years in a row.

Casino Royale

. How poetic that Robinhood replaces Caesars Entertainment in the S&P 500 index.

Prediction Markets Grow Up

. Sports and finance are converging in a trend consistent with Kalshi co-founder’s long-term vision “to financialize everything and create a tradeable asset out of any difference in opinion”.

Private Markets are the New Public Markets

Even the UK House of Lords felt the need to hold a hearing to “understand the growth in private credit and private equity funds”. Those honorable lords who read

Net Interest

have a head start:

Apollo’s Web

. Latest in a series of posts on Apollo

that started in

2022. If you want to see the future in finance, look at what the smartest financial engineers do on nights and weekends. That means watching Marc Rowan of Apollo.

Banking’s Disruptive Competitors

. BDCs are where public markets and private credit collide.

KKR’s Berkshire Dreams

. Bill Ackman isn’t the only one keen to ape Buffett. KKR’s co-CEO likens his new Strategic Holdings division to “a mini Berkshire Hathaway”.

The Battleground in Payments

Payments continues to be a fast-moving area at the intersection of finance and technology:

Partner Swap

.

Remember the show Wife Swap? Payments companies FIS and Global Payments are giving it a go, although they want to make it permanent.

Agentic Friday

. According to Salesforce, $14.2 billion in global online sales and $3 billion in US online sales were driven by AI and agents on Black Friday and that’s just the beginning.

Klarna Chameleon

. Come on, this has to be my best title of the year. Klarna was one of the ‘

Class of 25

’ fintechs to IPO this year. It hasn’t gone well.

Laying a New Infrastructure

Regulatory oversight of crypto loosened in 2025, and underlying blockchain technology emerged as a source of innovation independent of crypto trading:

Ready Layer One

. There’s a rush on to develop a purpose-built public blockchain for financial applications. In this post, we look at the runners and riders.

The New Money Market

. Stablecoins in circulation hit $309 billion in December, up from $207 billion at the beginning of the year. The US Treasury is paying attention and so are we.

Big Bang 2.0

. In a white, pin-striped suit in Cannes, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev laid out his vision. “I believe tokenization is the greatest capital markets innovation since the central limit order book.” Is he right?

My Favorites

Over the years, I’ve snuck a lot of biographical detail into my posts. Last year, for example, I reflected on

30 years in finance

. This year, I looked at 150 years of American finance – and my family’s role as a spectator. And having written plenty about hedge funds from an analytical perspective, I dish out what I’ve learned from investing in them.

“

We see the world speeding up. There’s more disruption, there’s more dislocation, the cost of standing still is greater today than it’s ever been.

” — Paul Taubman, Founder, Chairman and CEO of PJT Partners, December 2025.

The life of an M&A banker isn’t for everyone. “I’ve missed Christmas Eve and New Year’s and the Fourth of July holidays for deals a lot smaller than this,” one former banker

told

the Financial Times. “When the NBA players play on Christmas Day, nobody says our holidays are ruined,” said another. “They say isn’t it great you’re in the NBA. This is as good as it gets for investment bankers.”

Next week, when most of us are enjoying some downtime with our families, advisors working on the takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery will be hard at it. Those advising Netflix on its proposed acquisition have already put in a shift,

holding

daily morning calls in the two months leading up to the deal being announced – including multiple calls over Thanksgiving when everyone else was at home. Now, they have to be on standby as Warner Bros. navigates a competing bid from Paramount Skydance whose own bankers will be busy too.

For some, license to duck a family gathering could be a perk. ‘Maybe you’d rather spend Thanksgiving negotiating a financing package than discussing politics with your uncle?’

suggests

Bloomberg’s Matt Levine. For most, though, the motivation is commercial. Warner Bros. has promised to pay its advisors up to $225 million in fees (plus expenses). It has three firms on its roster and two of them are small. Evercore is eligible for $55 million and only employs 168 senior managing directors across its franchise; Allen & Company is eligible for $85 million and employs even fewer. For these firms, it’s a sizable ticket.

1

Evercore’s new European outpost illustrates just how lucrative this corner of finance can be. In October, the firm acquired London-based Robey Warshaw, a boutique employing just five senior managing directors. The firm is known for hiring former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne – at least until he

asked himself

what’s the most exciting and promising company in the world right now and left to join OpenAI. It has advised on seven of the largest ten deals in UK history and worked with over a quarter of FTSE 100 constituents. Over the past three years, those five bankers brought in £60 million of annual revenue ($80 million). The highest paid of them took home £40.5 million in a single record year.

Another UK firm lifts the lid on how these advisory firms go about their business. In March, the High Court adjudicated a dispute between veteran dealmaker Ian Hannam and one of his clients. Like Robey and Warshaw, who ran departments at Morgan Stanley and UBS prior to setting up their own firm, Hannam held a senior position at JPMorgan before launching H&P Advisory in 2010. A few years in, he advised Barrick Gold on its merger with Randgold Resources but when he was left off the billing as the deal was announced, he sued. In a

130-page ruling

, the judge lets us inside:

It is common for investment banks to do substantial amounts of work for clients on an unpaid basis in the hope of securing appointments (and fees) on transactions. It is also common for the appointment process to be somewhat informal. This raises a number of difficult legal questions where – as here – an advisor believes it has been appointed whilst its client believes it has not.

The ruling notes that periodic fees, hourly rates or other mechanisms for calculating the remuneration of professional advisers are not the norm, rather that fees are paid as a percentage of the value of the transaction concerned, in this case around 0.30%. CIBC and Barclays were on the Randgold side of the ticket and Hannam wanted in.

One expert outlined the work involved, identifying six stages of an M&A transaction from initiation to negotiation of key terms, negotiation of detailed terms, transaction announcement, implementation and completion. A lot of effort but ultimately, it all hangs on relationships (real or otherwise):

It is a tribute to Mr Hannam’s abilities as an investment banker that Mr Thornton’s evidence was that he listened to Mr Hannam because he perceived that he was very close to Dr Bristow, and Dr Bristow’s evidence was that he listened to Mr Hannam because he perceived that he was very close to Mr Thornton.

In the end, the value of Hannam’s work was put at $2 million, rather than the $10 million he first demanded and the $18 million he subsequently invoiced for. Whether that difference reflects rent extraction by advisors is moot; the model relies on cross‑subsidy, with hours of unbilled work recouped on the few deals that close.

Right now, the fee pool is swelling. Advisors are on course to earn close to $40 billion in revenue this year, according to Dealogic, and 2026 is shaping up to be better. “We’re running at very high backlogs right now, record backlogs… And we continue to add to that backlog,” said Evercore CEO John Weinberg at an investor conference last week. Goldman Sachs analysts project 20% growth in global M&A volumes over the next 12 months. For the market and its advisors, it promises to be a bumper year.

https://www.netinterest.co/p/stockpickers-paradise,Stockpicker’s Paradise,Why dispersion is back in financials – and what it means for 2026,2026-01-04T04:09:03.660375,Marc Rubinstein,"It’s coming up to ten years since I wound up my hedge fund. When it launched over a decade earlier, its objective was to generate absolute returns by investing – long and short – across the global financial sector. The sector focus was key. As specialists, we were equipped to ask the questions generalists didn’t know in an effort to uncover opportunities in this large yet opaque corner of the market.

For a long time, it worked. The sector was deep enough and disparate enough to sustain good returns if you knew where to look. And we looked everywhere: government-run banks in India, demutualised exchanges in Europe, consumer finance startups in the US. We shorted Northern Rock, Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns before they went bust, and we bought alternative asset managers, payments companies and brokerage firms before they rallied. At peak, we managed over $4 billion of assets.

But then things got hard. The free money regime of 2009-2021 kept many bad companies on life support and squeezed the profitability out of good ones. Regulation created uncertainty and subordinated the role of shareholders in banks. For many years, sector performance flatlined and, critically, dispersion of returns within it remained muted.

We could have concentrated our portfolio around Visa or Moody’s but sadly we didn’t have the foresight. So we closed – and we weren’t the only ones. Earlier this year I hosted Davide Serra, founder and CEO of Algebris Investments, on

Net Interest Extra

. “When we started in 2006, there were eleven specialists on financials,” he reminded me. “We’re now the only one left.”

The thing about markets is that nothing is permanent and, recently, the opportunity to extract returns from within the financial sector has re-emerged. Whisper it quietly but away from the distortion of the Magnificent Seven, banks have been outperforming even technology. In Europe, bank stocks are up almost 60% this year, versus tech which is up only 3%. In the US, banks are up 29% against the Nasdaq up 20%. Indeed, the best performing megacap stock in the S&P 500 this year is a financial. And – meat and drink to hedge funds – the worst performing stock? Also a financial.

One investor to spot the opportunity is Johnny de la Hey. Johnny started his career as a research analyst covering UK and European banks in London. In 1996, he joined Tiger Management with colleague Martin Hughes. When Tiger closed, the pair launched their own firm, Toscafund Asset Management, initially focused on the financial sector but later diversifying. This year, Johnny set up

a new firm

to revive his old strategy of long/short financials.

“A lot of generalists that pulled back out of this space have not been willing – and now are not able as quickly as they would like – to really grasp the opportunity,” he

says

. Since inception in February, his fund is up 48.8% net of fees.

Another investor to profit is Derek Pilecki, managing member and portfolio manager at Gator Capital Management in Florida. Derek set up his long/short financials fund in 2008 amid the financial crisis. Three months in, he was down nearly 30%. But he kept at it and he’s now having a strong run – up 160% since the end of 2022.

2

“I believe the financials sector is one of those sectors like energy or biotech where you need specialization to really dig down deep within the sector,” he

says

.

The global financial sector gives Johnny and Derek a deep pool to play in. MSCI’s World Financial Index tracks 236 stocks with a combined market capitalization of $67 trillion. The best performing this year was Robinhood (+220%); the worst was Fiserv (-67%). European banks did well; payments companies and alternative asset managers did poorly. Some stocks, like Robinhood and Edenred, continued along the same price trajectory they established last year; others, like Prudential PLC and TD Bank rebounded.

The year’s not quite over, but it’s been a good one for financial specialists. Overall, the spread between top and bottom quartile performers in the index was wider than in any year since 2009.

With more than 19.8 billion streams, he is Spotify’s most-played artist of 2025, ahead of Taylor, The Weeknd, Drake and Billie Eilish. His album,

Debí Tirar Más Fotos

, was also the year’s biggest – paving the way for him to perform at next year’s Super Bowl.

For a bettor who goes by the name

Domer

on the internet, this was good news. Earlier this year, he bet just over $100,000 that Bad Bunny would reign supreme and, with the

release

of the Spotify rankings this week, he booked a profit of $96,000. A side bet that Taylor Swift

wouldn’t

be the top Spotify artist of 2025 netted him a further $6,000. Several smaller, lower conviction bets lost him money but, overall, Domer cleared $87,000 wagering on people’s Spotify streaming habits.

Domer doesn’t just bet on music. He’s interested in politics and economics and culture. As one of the biggest users of prediction platform Polymarket, he’s placed over $420 million of bets since becoming a customer in 2022. One of his biggest wins was on JD Vance being nominated as Donald Trump’s running mate in 2024. His insight that Trump would choose a candidate with a monosyllabic surname persuaded him to put close to $120,000 down on an outcome initially priced as a 2% longshot.

Elsewhere, he correctly predicted that the Federal Reserve would cut rates by half a percentage point in September 2024 – a trade which earned him $150,000.

Since registering with Polymarket, Domer

has made

$2.4 million in profit. “I don’t think of myself as a gambler,” he

told

CBS News’ 60 Minutes this week. “I’m taking very, very well-researched views on things. I feel like it’s much more akin to investing.” Current exposures span Time magazine’s person of the year (he doesn’t think it will be the Pope), the next Federal Reserve chair (no announcement until next year), and box office receipts on the new Avatar movie (not as big as Wicked).

Domer is one of a growing band of people using prediction markets to express views across a range of events. Polymarket, founded in 2020, now has around 500,000

monthly active users

, though until recently it was banned in the US. Rival service Kalshi, which has been operational in the US since 2021,

counts

more than 4 million retail participants. Between them, notional trading volumes have grown from $500 million per week at the beginning of the year to over $2 billion today. Weekly volumes now routinely exceed the peaks reached during last year’s US election.

Kalshi co-founder, Tarek Mansour, is

bullish

. He

thinks

prediction markets could become as big as stock markets. “When we first started the company, this idea of a financial market that prices questions about the future, we were very drawn to it because if you could build such a financial market, it could be the largest of them all because the largest number of people will care.”

Investors are backing him. This week, Kalshi raised $1 billion in new funding at an $11 billion valuation, twice the value it secured just two months ago. Polymarket recently sold a 20% stake to financial exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange valuing it at $8 billion and is

reported

to be raising again.

We’ve discussed prediction markets here before. In last August’s

The Wisdom of Crowds

, we traced the regulatory journey platforms have been on to gain acceptance, drawing parallels to Chicago’s commodity exchanges over 100 years ago. Just as policymakers eventually warmed to those venues they once branded as gambling dens, they have softened their stance on prediction markets. In the past year, Kalshi won a lawsuit allowing it to list political event contracts and Polymarket was cleared to relaunch in the US after gaining approval for its acquisition of QCEX, a licensed derivatives exchange and clearinghouse. In October, founders of Kalshi and Polymarket joined CEOs of CME Group, Intercontinental Exchange, Cboe Global Markets and Nasdaq on

a panel

in Washington.

Shopify

has ushered 24 million unique shoppers through its platform since Black Friday commenced;

Stripe

has processed 92 million transactions. Tariffs may be eroding discounts on offer, but consumers are undeterred. At this rate, both firms look set to exceed records they achieved over Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend last year, when Shopify hit peak sales of $4.6 million per minute and Stripe did total transaction volume of $31 billion.

Shopify live BFCM dashboard

What makes this year different is that both companies have AI agents wandering through their pipes alongside regular human users. Shopify has already seen AI-driven traffic to its stores increase seven-fold since January, with orders attributed to AI searches increasing by 11x. That is only likely to grow. According to a

recent survey

conducted by Bain, 17% of US consumers say they’ll start their online holiday shopping this year with ChatGPT, Perplexity or another general AI assistant. Although lower than the 73% who still start with Amazon, it’s a share that is only going up.

It also reflects a new way of shopping. AI is already used widely for research and product comparison. As AI assistants integrate these features with search, they are additionally being used by consumers as a marketplace. Ultimately, we’re heading for a world in which AI should be able to navigate shopping options, negotiate deals and execute transactions independently of human direction. “Find me a pair of waterproof hiking boots in a size 8 under $150 that can be delivered by Friday,” could be something you would ask, and the agent would be able to scan available options, query product data in real time, check return policies, read shipping estimates, verify availability and place the order.

“We’re entering what is likely to be a whole new era of agentic commerce,” Shopify president Harley Finkelstein told investors earlier this month. His CEO, Tobi Lütke, is similarly bullish. Agentic commerce “will be done a lot and might even be a majority of commerce on the internet,” he

told

John Collison, president of Stripe. Amazon’s Andy Jassy goes further: “I do think that the exciting part of this, and the promise, is that AI and agentic commerce solutions are going to expand the amount of shopping that happens online.”

In a

recent report

, McKinsey puts some numbers around it. By 2030, its consultants estimate the US business-to-consumer retail market alone could see up to $1 trillion in orchestrated revenue from agentic commerce, with global projections as high as $3 trillion to $5 trillion. Payment platform Adyen comes in a little lower, at €2 trillion ($2.3 trillion) by 2030, but the direction of travel is clear.

With numbers like these, it’s no surprise that agentic commerce dominated recent earnings calls across the payments and e-commerce sectors. The companies positioning themselves to capitalize on this shift are making strategic moves that could reshape the entire e-commerce ecosystem. To explore what they are up to and which players stand to win or lose, read on.

For all the talk of bubbles in

equity markets

,

private credit

and elsewhere, the market that hosted the last great bubble has been quiet. It’s still vast: At roughly $13.5 trillion, more mortgage loans are outstanding than corporate bonds in the US. But its footprint has been shrinking. As

The Economist

notes

this week, mortgage balances have fallen by almost 30 percentage points relative to the size of the economy since the peak of the last boom, taking them back to late-1990s levels. Set against the value of American homes, the decline looks even starker: mortgage debt now amounts to barely a quarter of household real-estate wealth, the lowest share in more than six decades.

Source: The Economist

For mortgage bankers, this didn’t initially pose much of a problem. As long as interest rates were drifting lower, they could rely on a steady stream of refinancing. Every decline in rates invited borrowers to reshuffle their loans, creating new mortgages even when nothing new was being financed. It was flow without growth – and for years it kept the business humming. When rates fell to almost unimaginable lows in 2021 – touching 2.65% on a 30 year fixed-rate mortgage – originations swelled to $4.4 trillion, more than twice their usual level, handing a windfall to the bankers who sat in the middle.

But with rates now above 6%, those days are long gone, and refinancing activity has collapsed. Intercontinental Exchange, owner of a mortgage technology platform,

estimates

that at current rates, there are 1.7 million borrowers out there with capacity to refinance. That’s up from a few years ago, but it’s way down on the 17 million borrowers whose mortgages became refinanceable when rates began their descent. Most borrowers are already on rates below 6%; many boast rates below 4%.

Source: MBA, ICE Origination Data, FHLMC PMMS; Highly qualified refinance candidates are defined as those with 720+ credit scores, 20% equity, and potential rate savings of 75 bps or more

That leaves the purchase market as the primary source of new mortgage activity. Trouble is, those investors who assume the ultimate risk of mortgage default don’t want to take on much more. Unlike peers in other markets, their tolerance for absorbing loss is exceptionally low. The Urban Institute’s Housing Credit Availability Index sits at an all-time trough. Such risk aversion is also reflected in credit scores. In 2003 35% of mortgages went to borrowers with credit scores below 720; currently, the proportion is only 22%. Denial rates in the purchase segment hover around 10%.

Even when a mortgage application is accepted, the cost can be high. Although some of that is driven by investor demands, tighter regulation also pays a part. “I’ve been talking about it for years,” said JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon in October. “They should focus on reducing securitization requirements, origination requirements, servicing requirements, and we think you can reduce the cost of mortgages 30 or 40 basis points overall, without creating any additional risk. They’re just excessive stuff put in place after the Great Financial Crisis, which obviously demanded a response, but it’s excessive.”

There’s been a lot of discussion recently about affordability and a tighter mortgage market feeds into that. When home prices were rising and mortgage rates were falling, the market cleared. With high home prices and high mortgage rates, it ceases to function for segments of the population. The American 30-year fixed-rate fully prepayable mortgage is a

curious

product, but although an entire apparatus exists to ensure its liquidity, it doesn’t help liquidity in the underlying housing market when borrowers face 70%+ increases in mortgage payments if they move. No wonder the median homebuyer age today is nearly 60, and a first-time home buyer is now 40, according to the National Association of Realtors.

“In terms of mortgages and home lending, no secret, that has been a headwind to our loan growth as we continue to see paydowns on our portfolios,” said JPMorgan at a recent investor presentation. “And as a result, we expect to continue to see slow declines in our home lending portfolios.”

Affordability clearly has wider economic implications, but where does it leave the mortgage industry? To explore the issue through the lens of mortgage originator Rocket and mortgage guarantor Fannie Mae, read on.

Satya Nadella

, CEO, Microsoft, November 2025

A few weeks ago,

we harked back to 1907

to hunt down a blueprint for what is going on in markets today. The following week,

we looked at 2000

. This week, we turn our attention to 2008.

This isn’t something I set out to do. As much as there are

clear differences

between the current environment and that of 1999/2000, the differences with 2007/2008 are even more stark. Yet over the past few months, I’ve watched as a new asset class has emerged. Back in 2023, neocloud company CoreWeave raised a $2.3 billion debt facility collateralized by Nvidia AI chips. It has since gone public, raising a further $14 billion in debt and equity this year alone. Alongside it, other companies have issued debt similarly backed by AI chips (GPUs) and data center infrastructure. AI-related companies have collectively issued around $170 billion of US-dollar denominated credit so far this year according to Goldman Sachs – more than the prior three years combined and, based on their diminishing cash ratios, will continue to tap debt markets for capital.

But just as the financing model of 2007 hinged on a standardised set of assumptions around home price inflation, the current model rests on assumptions around the useful life of those chips – assumptions that are currently being challenged. CoreWeave estimates a six-year useful life for its computing equipment; other borrowers project less. The difference between six years and four years on a depreciation schedule underpinning a piece of GPU collateral is not far off the difference between +2% and zero home price inflation on a piece of housing collateral.

And just as the launch of the ABX subprime index in January 2006 put a spotlight on a previously opaque part of the market – and was in many ways the coordination point for the unwind that then unfolded – the Silicon Data H100 Rental Index, launched in May 2025, adds transparency to the compute market by tracking the hourly cost of renting a GPU. The goal,

according

to its founder, is to turn GPUs into a benchmarked asset class that can be traded like any other financial instrument. Reflecting evolving supply–demand dynamics in the GPU rental market, the index has been trading down:

There’s one more thing that strikes me as resonant of the 2008 period: attacks on short-sellers. Short-selling is a topic we’ve

explored

here before. As long ago as 1917, financier Bernard Baruch made the case for it: “A market without bears would be like a nation without a free press. There would be no one to criticise and restrain the false optimism that always leads to disaster.”

Since then, short-sellers have faced regular waves of vilification. In 2008, Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack accused them of “destroying a storied franchise, built over almost three-quarters of a century of hard work and integrity.” While short-sellers have been under pressure since 2021 (perhaps, to Baruch’s analogy, not uncorrelated to pressure faced by the free press) the current round of abuse seems strangely disproportionate. “I’m currently in a battle with short-sellers,” Palantir CEO Alex Karp

said

at the start of an interview this week. “Primarily because they could go short some carcinogenic company but they have to short arguably the best company in this country and in the world by any metric. And by the way, judge us by our enemies… What should our market cap be based on that standard?”

It came a couple of weeks after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman

expressed

a desire to enter the battle himself. Asked how he can reconcile $13 billion of annualised revenue – the rate in July, which is expected to rise to $20 billion by year end – with $1.4 trillion of spending commitments, he offered to find a buyer for the interviewer’s shares. “There are not many times that I want to be a public company,” he said, but one of the rare times it’s appealing is when there are critics. “I would love to tell them they could just short the stock and I would love to see them get burned on that.”

Bubble Trouble

, was very widely read – it’s clearly a topical issue. Any thoughts or feedback, drop me a line. This week, we’re back to banking. I’ve written about

JPMorgan

here before and

Citigroup

and

Wells Fargo

, but Bank of America has mostly escaped my scrutiny. Let’s address that.

I first met Brian Moynihan in early 2010, in a wood‑paneled room at Claridge’s. He was passing through London a few weeks into his appointment as Bank of America’s CEO and carved out some time to meet a small group of investors. The bank was still reeling from the financial crisis and the costly Merrill Lynch and

Countrywide

acquisitions he had inherited. The following year, at a charity dinner, Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman

needled him

: “Brian Moynihan is here tonight. He’s the CEO of Bank of America. As many of you know, Brian’s brother Patrick runs a Catholic boarding school in Haiti. Their parents must be so proud to see two of their boys running an under-funded, non-profit organization.”

Fifteen years later, Moynihan is still at the helm, making him the second longest serving CEO of a major US bank, behind Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan. (His brother stepped down as president of The Haitian Project in 2019.) With the stock close to reclaiming its November 2006 all‑time high, the company this week hosted a glitzy

investor day

in Moynihan’s hometown of Boston. Over six hours of presentations, Moynihan and his team articulated the company’s positioning, strategy and financial outlook.

Investor days are commonplace – JPMorgan hosts one every year. They impose discipline on management and educate the market on the contours of a business. This month alone, Adyen, S&P Global, Deutsche Bank, Block and Edenred will host them – companies I’ve discussed here before. But for Bank of America, a full‑scale investor day is a novelty. As one of the country’s largest financial intermediaries, with relationships across a third of US households, the event doubles as a window into the economy.

, December 5, 1996

If you’ve been signed up to

Net Interest

for a while, you will have

read me reminisce

about the bursting of the dot-com and telco bubble in 2000. It was one of several boom-and-bust cycles I saw up close as an analyst and investor. I entered the industry too late to catch the Japanese stock bubble and I am too young to remember historic classics such as the Nifty Fifty (1973), but the tech crash, the housing collapse and the Chinese stock bubble all

left their mark

.

So it’s with a sense of foreboding that I note the rising number of voices drawing parallels between 2000 and today. “You’re going to see a similar phenomenon here,” Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon

told

delegates at Italian Tech Week earlier this month. “I wouldn’t be surprised if, in the next 12 to 24 months, we see a drawdown with respect to equity markets… I think that there will be a lot of capital that’s deployed that will turn out to not deliver returns, and when that happens, people won’t feel good.” At the same event, Jeff Bezos

characterized

the current environment as “kind of an industrial bubble.” Even AI insiders are expressing caution. “I do think some investors are likely to lose a lot of money,”

said

Sam Altman.

Since these remarks were made, Nvidia’s market value has risen past $5 trillion. In aggregate, AI-related stocks

account for

about 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth and 90% of capital spending growth since ChatGPT launched in November 2022. The five largest US technology companies are now

My former colleague Andrew Garthwaite, UBS’s chief global equity strategist, argues that the preconditions for a bubble are certainly in place. He highlights seven factors that typically underpin bubbles:

A pervasive “buy‑the‑dip” mentality. This tends to emerge when equities beat bonds by more than 5% a year for a decade; over the past ten years, equities have outperformed by around 14% a year.

A “this time is different” consensus tied to a major new technology. This comports with

a 2018 study

which found that in a sample of 51 major innovations introduced between 1825 and 2000, bubbles in equity prices emerged in 73% of the cases.

A roughly 25‑year gap since the prior bubble, allowing a new (untainted) investor cohort to emerge.

Retail buying – a theme

we’ve discussed

here before. Roughly 21% of US households now own individual stocks (33% including funds) with overall equity ownership having regained all ground lost since the dot-com crash. And to echo the first point, retail loves to buy the dip: Individual investors

successfully bought stocks

all the way through the April market correction.

Profit pressure in the broader market. In the late‑1990s boom, national accounts profits peaked in 1997; in Japan, trailing earnings per share growth was flat in 1989, even as it was flattered by corporate stock trading. Today, outside the top ten companies in the US, 12‑month forward earnings per share growth is close to zero.

Loose monetary conditions, reinforced by this week’s rate cut, lowering discount rates and supporting risk appetite.

While Garthwaite’s framework supports the notion that a bubble is inflating, it doesn’t map its contours. To do that, we need to dig deeper.",https://www.netinterest.co

Already etched into Wall Street folklore, events of that day have attracted renewed interest with the release of Andrew Ross Sorkin’s latest book,

1929

.

Sorkin describes the scene:

[Exchange superintendent William] Crawford watched the chronometer tick. At exactly 10 a.m. he punched the bell to signal the opening of trading. Men began yelling and gesticulating. Phones started ringing incessantly. The bloodbath had begun… At first the sell-off was driven by brokers liquidating the accounts of customers who couldn’t meet their margin calls. But the panic soon became so pervasive that brokers were willing to sell at any price. Brokers, still behind from processing the previous night’s paperwork, struggled to keep up… By the time it ended, the turmoil of Thursday, October 24, broke records. It was the heaviest trading day in the history of the New York Stock Exchange, with brokers handling transactions of 974 different stocks, with 12,894,650 shares changing hands. The stock ticker recorded the day’s final trades at 7:08 p.m., more than four hours late.

1

Sorkin doesn’t address it in his book but on his podcast tour, he’s consistently asked whether he sees parallels between the conditions that led to the crash and today’s markets. On the

All-In Podcast

, he characterizes Radio Corporation of America (RCA) – whose stock price rose 200-fold during the 1920s – as the Nvidia of its time. He compares how wealthy financiers gained celebrity through magazine covers then, much as they command attention through social media today. Underlying it all, he observes, speculation remains the twin of innovation. “I think there’s probably some things that are happening in our economy today that do mirror that period,” he says.

Such pattern-matching is deeply human – we instinctively search history for roadmaps to the future. Yet while there are echoes of 1929 in today’s markets, especially around retail participation in the market, it’s another historical episode that may offer even more relevant parallels. The Panic of 1907, where shadow banking created systemic vulnerabilities, captures crucial features of our current financial system that the 1929 crash doesn’t illuminate. It, too, marks its anniversary this week.

In their book,

The Panic of 1907

, Robert Bruner and Sean Carr describe events:

On Tuesday morning, October 22, the mid-autumn weather in New York City was fair and mild. That was fortunate since there was already an eddying crowd outside the Knickerbocker Trust Company’s great bronze doors at Fifth Avenue and Thirty-fourth Street by 9 a.m. Altogether about 100 people, mostly small shopkeepers, mechanics, and clerks, waited patiently on the sidewalk to reclaim their deposits. Even when the firm opened at its regular time an hour later, everything remained orderly and there were no violent scenes, tears, or frantic hand-wringing. Men stood in one primary line and women stepped into a separate room to the left of the bank’s main entrance. Within 15 minutes, the line extended out the doors and down the steps to the sidewalk, as company officers and policemen marshaled the growing crowd into formation.

Knickerbocker Trust was one of a new wave of shadow banks that had emerged since the 1880s. Less regulated than traditional banks, trust companies could assume more risk and take advantage of opportunities not available to banks. They grew explosively: while their lending amounted to just half that of New York’s national banks in 1890, by 1906 they had achieved parity. With few payment services to manage, they maintained minimal cash reserves and remained outside the protective umbrella of the New York Clearing House, a precursor to the Federal Reserve.

If only we could do this electronically

Trust companies no longer enjoy the same status, but their legacy survives in other forms. When the global Financial Stability Board

last surveyed

non-bank financial intermediaries, they put their share of total global financial assets at 49.1%, up from 43.1% in 2008. As in 1906, what goes on in this corner of the market is often opaque yet it is increasingly supported by bank lending and inter-relationships between the various institutions.

“Yes, there will be additional risk in that category that we will see when we have a downturn,”

said

JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon on his earnings call last week. “I expect it to be a little bit worse than other people expect it to be, because we don’t know all the underwriting standards that all these people did… I would suspect that some of those standards may not be as good as you think.”

Firms are bigger, compliance stricter, technology bolder. But in a corner of New York, there’s a firm that tries hard to retain the magic. “Jefferies is a story of Wall Street in a world that doesn’t have a lot of Wall Street left in it,” its president, Brian Friedman

said

a few years back. With a headcount of 6,000 – far fewer than the 48,300 employed at Goldman Sachs or 94,200 in the commercial and investment bank at JPMorgan – the firm embraces old-school principles. “Meritocracy, always,” Friedman and his CEO, Rich Handler,

wrote

in a memo earlier this month, and “long-term greedy.”

The pair list thirteen principles in total. Waking up (and going to sleep) thinking about clients is a given, but the firm’s small size affords it some luxuries. “Politics, emotion, alternative agendas, short-term thinking, and bureaucracy destroy organizations and must be snuffed out relentlessly,” is one. Another is that “it is…okay to admit when you are wrong and pivot.” It’s the thirteenth principle, though, that is currently being tested. “Arrogance leads to mistakes and upsets,” Rich and Brian declare. “We take nothing for granted at Jefferies and embrace the fact that we have to prove ourselves worthy every single day to every constituency that we are so fortunate to serve.”

Since hitting send on the memo, they’ve been summoned by markets and by clients to prove themselves worthy. Last week, they

revealed

that a subsidiary in their asset management division, Point Bonita Capital, holds $715 million of assets linked to bankrupt auto parts manufacturer First Brands Group, representing nearly a quarter of its $3 billion trade-finance portfolio (which is backed by $1.9 billion of invested equity). As an investor in the fund itself, Jefferies has $43 million of direct exposure (plus $2 million from other sources) but it’s the reputational fallout from the subsidiary’s risk management practices that may prove more harmful. Unsurprisingly, the market doesn’t like it. Since mid-September, when First Brands’ advisers began to explore a bankruptcy, Jefferies stock is down 30%, wiping $3.8 billion off its market value. That the drop is more than 85 times the firm’s direct exposure reflects investors’ broader concerns.

Rich and Brian have been around a long time – reminding us among their thirteen principles that they have led the firm for 25 years – so they’ve seen this kind of thing before. They will remember how in 2007, another scrappy firm oversaw losses on funds in its asset management subsidiary. Bear Stearns had run a ‘high-grade structured credit strategies fund’ from within its asset management division since 2003 and, in 2006, it added a higher-leveraged, higher-risk ‘enhanced fund’ alongside it. Both funds were heavily exposed to subprime mortgage-backed CDOs. After marking the enhanced fund down 6.6% in April, losses accelerated as these securities plunged in value. By July, the high-grade fund was down 91% and the enhanced fund had lost everything. At the end of the month, both filed for bankruptcy.

On Sunday, Rich and Brian came out fighting. “There has been an impact on our equity market value and credit perception that is meaningfully overdone,” they

wrote

in a letter to clients, stakeholders and friends of Jefferies. It doesn’t normally bode well when you have to tell market participants that you have ample liquidity on a Sunday night, but the pair went for it, detailing the firm’s financial attributes. Yesterday, they hosted an annual investor meeting where they delivered similar messages.

Don’t look at the stock price!

Jefferies is used to taking hits. In 1987, it fell under the spotlight after its founder pleaded guilty to securities fraud and was banned from the industry. It survived the global financial crisis, but came under pressure a couple of years later when the sovereign debt crisis flared up in Europe. As CEO, Rich has swatted away multiple threats including from failed investment firm Archegos when he instructed his traders to eliminate all exposure in the time it took him to

Tell someone you bank with ‘First Federal Bank’ and you’ll need to clarify if you mean the one in Florida, or North Carolina, or Tennessee, or one of the 17 First Federal Savings and Loan Associations scattered across the country. The sparsely populated state of North Dakota alone has more banks than Canada, its neighbor to the north – a country with 50x the population. Banks are so numerous that below a certain threshold, they can fail without so much as a whimper. Just this year, regulators shut down two banks without making headlines: The Santa Anna National Bank in Texas, with $64 million in assets, and Pulaski Savings Bank in Chicago, with $50 million in assets.

Other utilities like rail and telecommunications have attained similar levels of consolidation. More curious, though, is how deeply this fragmented banking structure is woven into American identity. Perhaps it’s the civic ideal immortalized in classics like

It’s a Wonderful Life

This week, the Federal Reserve hosted

a conference

in Washington to celebrate them. In attendance were financial celebrities including Jim Cramer of CNBC

Mad Money

, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman and Robinhood founder Vlad Tenev. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was also there.

“I remember listening to Farm Radio right after the Silicon Valley [Bank] debacle,” he told the audience (apparently he is the first Treasury Secretary since the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries who is also a farmer). “And I was just struck by what the presenter was saying…

The big banks they’re going to come in, they’re going to buy up our banks; they don’t play baseball with your son, they don’t play softball with your daughter, they don’t go to your place of worship, they don’t know you from the Rotary Club — what are we going to do?

”

Bessent affirmed the administration’s commitment to protecting smaller banks. “We want to get back to leveling the playing field,” he said. Others were equally effusive. “The backbone of America,” Jim Cramer described them. “It’s good to have local banks,” said Schwarzman. Indeed, so culturally resonant is the ideal of community banks that even Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank JPMorgan, pays homage. “Regional and community banks have exceptional local knowledge and presence and are critical in serving thousands of towns and certain geographies,” he

writes

in his shareholder letter.

Where does this extraordinary political and cultural sway come from, and can it persist? In a world where technology and scale increasingly determine competitive advantage, how long can America’s distinctive banking structure survive?

“The capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them.”

In December of 2024, before Trump took office,

I wrote about the disturbing possibility

that the man once known as a consummate China hawk would sell America out to its great rival. I wrote that the key tell would be whether Trump dropped the export controls on chips and chipmaking equipment implemented during Biden’s presidency:

[T]here’s one big important thing Trump could do to sabotage America’s effort to stand up to Chinese power. He could cancel

the export controls

that the Biden administration placed on the Chinese semiconductor industry. Removing export controls wouldn’t require legislative action — Trump could just do it whenever he wanted. And because the policy is not really in the limelight, there probably wouldn’t be a popular backlash to its cancellation. So export controls are pretty much a pure test of Trump’s China policy — if he keeps them, it’s because he

wants

to stand up to China, and if he cancels them, it means he doesn’t…

[E]xport controls are doing what they’re designed to do. They’re not killing China’s chip industry, but they’re slowing it down in important ways, and letting the U.S. retain its technological edge…These export controls [are] absolutely crucial if the U.S. is going to maintain any kind of a military-technological edge over China. Chips are

the foundation of

all

modern weaponry

, from missiles to drones to satellites to advanced fighter jets. And AI itself, which depends on advanced chips for training and inference, is rapidly becoming an essential weapon of war. When autonomous drone swarms hit the battlefield, AI will become even more crucial to the military balance.

The U.S. probably cannot out-manufacture China, even with all the tariffs and industrial policies in the world. America needs to retain a technological edge to balance out its productive weakness — an advantage in quality to balance out its deficiency in quantity. Semiconductors are that edge. If Trump cancels the export controls, it will mean he’s destroying America’s best chance to keep its weapons ahead of China’s weapons.

In mid-2025 there was a rumor that Trump was going to allow sales of an Nvidia chip called the h20 to China. Ultimately the administration backed off amid a torrent of criticism from hawkish elites. But in December,

Trump announced

that he would allow the sale of a far more powerful Nvidia chip, the H200. The Institute for Progress had

a good post explaining what this means

:

The decision [to sell H200s] would be a substantial departure from the Trump administration’s

current export control strategy

, which seeks to deny powerful AI compute to strategic rivals. The H200 would be almost 6x as powerful as the H20…China would have access to chips that outperform any chip its companies can domestically produce, and at much higher quantities. Huawei is not planning to produce an AI chip matching the H200 until Q4 2027 at the earliest. Even if this timeline holds, China’s

severe chip manufacturing bottlenecks

mean that it will not be able to produce these chips at scale, reaching only 1–4% of US production in 2025 and 1–2% in 2026…Chinese AI labs would be able to build AI supercomputers that achieve performance similar to top US AI supercomputers, albeit at a cost premium of roughly 50% for training and 1-5x for inference, depending on workload…

With no AI chip exports to China and no smuggling, we estimate the US would hold a 21–49x advantage in 2026-produced AI compute, depending on whether FP4 or FP8 performance is used for Blackwell chips.

7

This advantage would translate into a much greater American capacity to train frontier models, support more and better-resourced AI and cloud companies, and run more powerful inference workloads for more capable AI models and agents. Unrestricted H200 exports would shrink this advantage to between 6.7x and 1.2x, depending on the scale of Chinese demand and the degree of adoption of FP4. [emphasis mine]

IFP has a number of great graphics showing how much H200 sales to China will erode America’s advantage in AI compute:

Source:

IFP

If the U.S. cared about staying ahead of China in the AI race, why would we sell H200s to China? The obvious answer is that there is no reason we would, and that thus Trump does

not

care about staying ahead of China in the AI race — that for either personal or political reasons, Trump has decided to facilitate the rise of Chinese power rather than impede it.

Some people actually do argue that selling China H200s will maintain America’s technological advantage. They argue that if Chinese companies are allowed to buy H200s, they will remain dependent on American chip designs (and Taiwanese chip manufacturing), and will thus fail to build their own indigenous rivals to America’s AI chip industry. As

Dmitri Alperovitch writes

in the Wall Street Journal, this is a dangerous pipe dream:

Rather than grow dependent, China will take Nvidia chips while they are available, use them to train models to compete with American frontier variants and continue to invest heavily in domestic alternatives like Huawei’s Ascend chips. When those are good enough, the firms will drop Nvidia—and quickly.

The notion that restrictions “accelerate Beijing’s move toward alternatives” misses a critical reality: Technological self-sufficiency is a Xi Jinping mandate. He isn’t going to allow China to rely on an American tech stack. The Communist Party is already investing in an alternative supply chain and will limit Nvidia imports if needed to ensure sufficient domestic demand for Huawei. The question isn’t whether China pursues self-sufficiency; it’s whether we hand it advanced capabilities during its years-long catch-up period.

In a post back in November,

I put it a little more bluntly

:

If you want to keep China hooked on American products for strategic reasons, it’s probably a bad idea to scream “HEY CHINA, WE’RE SELLING YOU CHIPS AND EQUIPMENT SO YOU’LL STAY HOOKED ON OUR PRODUCTS, FOR STRATEGIC REASONS!!”. China’s leaders, being smarter than, say, a gerbil, will

refuse to take this bait

, and will work hard on developing their own indigenous chip supply chain anyway. Which is

exactly what they’ve been doing for over a decade now

.

In fact, we can already see my argument being proven right in real time. Chinese AI companies are simply

buying chips from both Huawei

and

Nvidia

:

This is why selling China H200s won’t actually slow down China’s indigenization efforts. China’s companies will buy as many Chinese-made chips as they can, and simply buy American chips on top of that.

This will give Chinese AI companies a huge advantage. Right now, despite its mighty efforts to catch up, China is proving unable to match America’s chip production capabilities (in large part because of export controls on chipmaking equipment):

Source:

CFR

Because China can’t match America’s chip production, selling America’s H200s to China will give Chinese AI companies a huge boost in their competition with American AI companies. Currently, China’s

compute limitations

are

the main reason

that

America’s AI models are better

:

Selling China H200s will help alleviate those constraints, and their models will catch up.

Opponents of export controls will doubtless retort by asking: So what? Why should the U.S. try to maintain a lead over China in AI modeling?

It’s a good and important question. The main reason is

deterrence

. Right now, China is

menacing Taiwan

and

Japan

, and threatening to start World War 3. The main thing stopping it from starting a war is the chance that it would lose such a conflict — which would doubtless end in Xi Jinping losing power, and quite possibly his life.

China can out-manufacture the U.S. easily at this point. So the main way China would lose a war is if the U.S. used its technological edge to prevail in a short, limited conflict. Thus, if that technological edge evaporates, China is much more likely to start a war of conquest.

As long as America is way ahead in the AI race, China will therefore be more hesitant to start a world-shattering war. There will always be the lurking possibility that America’s lead in AI tech will somehow allow it to thwart China’s attacks. It’s not clear how LLMs will be used for military applications — perhaps some sort of coordination of drone swarms, or large-scale hacking attacks — but as long as America is clearly better than China in the most versatile and important new technology, it will give China’s leaders one more reason to delay their attacks on Taiwan and Japan.

So it’s in America’s interest to preserve its technological edge in AI for as long as possible. If China can be kept from launching a war for just 5 or 10 more years, something could change that makes World War III far less likely — Xi Jinping could be unseated and replaced with a less bellicose leader, China’s

rapidly aging demographics

might reduce popular appetite for war,

India could develop

to the point where China doesn’t enjoy overwhelming primacy in Asia, and so on.

Selling China H200s thus makes World War III a bit more likely in the next decade.

On top of all of that, there’s also the possibility that denying China U.S. chips could cause their domestic tech ecosystem to become isolated from the global ecosystem — a condition known as “

Galapagos syndrome

”. If Chinese AI companies buy only from Chinese chip companies, then Chinese chips may become optimized for the domestic market rather than the international market. This could ultimately limit the scale of China’s chip industry, preserving an advantage for American and allied chipmakers — an advantage that would also have obvious military benefits.

China’s government knows all of this, of course, which is why

it’s always calling

for the U.S. to end its export controls. If export controls really helped China indigenize its chip industry, it would welcome the controls — or at least, accept them with minimal grumbling.

China also tries to give ammunition to America’s internal opponents of export controls, by announcing big “breakthroughs” in chip manufacturing. For example, back in 2022, China announced that

it had manufactured 7nm chips

— something that export controls on advanced chipmaking equipment was supposed to prevent. But

as I wrote in 2024

, this was a bit of a Potemkin breakthrough:

SMIC, the Chinese foundry company that created the 7nm chip, was rumored to be advancing quickly to 5nm. But the company has reportedly

delayed its 5nm release until at least 2026

. This has

left SMIC’s customer Huawei in the lurch

, relying on technology that’s fast becoming obsolete. Even SMIC’s 7nm process, hailed as a catastrophic failure for export controls, is actually

not achieving good yields

, and is reportedly having reliability issues. This is probably

hurting Huawei’s production

of leading-edge phones. In the last five years,

over 22,000 Chinese semiconductor companies have reportedly shut down

….Huawei’s own chip production is

probably suffering as well

, with

very low yields

…Meanwhile,

Chinese companies are pessimistic

about their ability to keep up with leading-edge chipmakers without access to the latest chipmaking tools from the Netherlands, the U.S., and Japan.

By 2025, it was clear that China’s chipmaking technology had actually stalled, with rumored further breakthroughs to 5nm

failing to materialize

, and with Huawei

downplaying the importance

of making 7nm chips at all.

But the Potemkin breakthrough of 7nm chips probably helped opponents of export controls make their case to the Trump administration, allowing them to claim that China’s indigenization drive was succeeding. With the lifting of export controls on the H200, China won on the battlefield of information warfare what it had been unable to win in the laboratory.

And as if on queue, I’m now reading that China has

made a stunning breakthrough

in Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV), the most powerful and important chipmaking technology in the world:

In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance…Completed in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML.

It seems only a matter of time before opponents of U.S. export controls are using this stunning “breakthrough” to argue that the U.S. should allow ASML to sell EUV machines to China in order to keep China “hooked” on Western technology — the same terrible argument that resulted in the sale of H200s.

But read the fine print, and it turns out that China’s supposed breakthrough is less than it appears:

China's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips…China still faces major technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce…The availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028…But those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030.

So it’s not even clear that China’s supposed EUV prototype even works yet — or that it will

ever

work. Nor is it clear how China plants to source high-end components such as the ultra-smooth mirrors that only the German company Zeiss can make, and which are an essential input to EUV. There is every possibility that this is another Potemkin breakthrough.

Except it seems inevitable that before too long, ASML executives will be pointing to stories like this, and whispering to Trump that unless he lets them sell EUV machines, the Chinese will just invent their own. And it seems likely that as with H200s, the administration will fall for it, sacrificing one of the key technological edges that could have deterred WW3 — or helped America win it. Whichever communist

said that

“capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them” appears to have been right on the money.

2025 is drawing to a close, so here’s one last roundup of interesting econ-related items from around the web. I don’t have any podcasts for you this week, but an episode of “Doom Debates” with Liron Shapira will be coming out soon.

1. Why Abundance is good for small business

It always seemed a bit silly

that some of the antitrust people decided to start a rhetorical fight with the Abundance people. After all, market power decreases abundance (since there’s a deadweight loss from monopoly). So theoretically these folks should be on the same side.

But for whatever reason, some folks still insist on seeing a contradiction here. For example,

Austin Ahlman asks

how the Abundance movement will help a small businessperson trying to revitalize his hometown:

And

Zephyr Teachout asks

what Abundance can offer to small pharmacists struggling in the face of competition from big chains:

I don’t sneer at questions like these; they are good and important questions. I’m

a big supporter of small business

, which I view as a pillar of the middle class, a provider of variety, and a positive force in urban politics. So I definitely want policies that support it.

In fact, the Abundance idea has a

huge

amount to offer small businesses. For example, let’s answer Teachout’s question first. Pharmacies face a huge number of regulatory barriers. It’s expensive, difficult, and time-consuming to get a permit to open a pharmacy. Renovating a space costs a lot of money and requires more onerous approvals and permits. There’s plenty of laborious labor regulation that raises the cost of hiring workers. And so on.

These costs function as

barriers to entry

for businesses. Big chain pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens can easily pay those costs and take the required time; in fact, they’ve already budgeted the costs in. But for small independent pharmacies, these regulatory costs and delays are a huge burden. This puts a thumb on the scale for the big chains, making it a lot easier for them to drive the mom-and-pops out of business.

Abundance isn’t purely a deregulatory project — there’s a lot of other stuff involved — but it definitely wants to reduce these sorts of regulatory overhead costs. That will make it much easier for small businesses to compete.

This also helps answer Austin Ahlman’s question about the businessman trying to revitalize his hometown; reducing regulation will help speed him on his quest. But for a small business in a declining town,

demand

is more important than regulation. Where will the small businessman get customers?

Abundance can help here too. Building

infrastructure

— roads, sewers, and electrical grids — will help people move to the declining town and revitalize it. Easy permitting for solar power and transmission will not only give the businessman cheap electricity, but will also lure industry to the area, bringing in workers who will then become the businessman’s customers. And so on.

Abundance is, at its core, an idea that will make it much easier to run a small business. Fortunately, local politicians from Zohran Mamadani to Daniel Lurie are

embracing that idea

, promising to reduce regulatory costs in their cities in order to help their small businesspeople. “Antimonopoly” intellectuals should pay attention.

2. “Luxury” houses reduce rents for people who live in “affordable” houses

Speaking of abundance, the quest to lower rents by building more housing is starting to bear a little fruit. Emily Flitter and Nadja Popovich

report

that a few big American cities have built a bunch of housing, and that almost all of these cities have seen big drops in rent. Meanwhile, the cities that build less housing have seen much less of a drop:

Source:

Bloomberg

Now, correlation isn’t causation, as we all know. But reverse causation is probably not happening here — it makes absolutely no sense that falling rents would spark a building boom. And what other thing could be causing cities like Austin, Raleigh, Phoenix and Denver to both build more housing

and

have lower rents at the same time? If rents were falling because demand for housing in these cities were falling, we would probably not see housing booms there (and we can just look and see that all of these cities have growing populations anyway).

So unless this pattern is purely random chance, or there’s some other factor that’s hard to imagine, it means that building more housing lowers rents. Which is exactly what the simple, “Econ 101” theory of supply and demand would predict. And which is exactly what careful studies of natural experiments have

shown again and again

.

Note that as Flitter and Popovich report, the housing being built in these increasingly affordable boom-towns is almost entirely

market-rate

housing, or what anti-housing activists often pejoratively refer to as “luxury” housing. The activists have trouble understanding how building housing for high-income yuppie types could possibly lower rents. But it’s very simple — if you build places for high-earning yuppies to live, they don’t go bidding on older housing and sparking a price war that pushes middle-class and working-class people out of their homes.

Essentially, high-end housing acts as a “yuppie fishtank” that prevents an influx of high earners from raising rents for everyone else:

You can call this a “trickle-down” effect all you want, but a nasty-sounding label doesn’t change the basic economics of the situation. Building more market-rate housing lowers rents.

3. Why tariffs haven’t crushed the U.S. economy

A lot of people are asking why the U.S. economy has been so resilient in the face of Trump’s tariffs. The effects of the tariffs are evident —

import prices are rising

, the

manufacturing industry is suffering

from more expensive inputs, and this may be behind a gradual

rise in unemployment

. But overall, even though American consumers are incredibly pessimistic on surveys, growth remains solid and employment remains high. What’s going on here?

Were economists wrong

to warn about the dangers of tariffs? And if not, where is the economic calamity we were promised?

A big piece of the puzzle is that actual tariffs are not nearly as high as the official rates that the Trump administration has announced (to say nothing of the rates Trump was threatening back in April). The statutory tariff rate, calculated using the pre-tariff export mix, was 27.5% in September, but the actual rate U.S. importers were paying was only 14%:

Source:

Gopinath and Neiman (2025)

That chart is from

Gopinath and Neiman (2025)

, who explain that the Trump administration has used a large number of carve-outs and exceptions to reduce the economic pain from its own policy:

Specific products or even specific companies (that commit to build manufacturing plants in the United States, say) have been offered exemptions from the tariffs. For example, various semiconductors were granted exemptions from the reciprocal tariffs announced by the United States in early April 2025. As a result…semiconductors have an actual tariff rate of only 9 percent despite a much larger statutory tariff of 24 percent. This same exemption also drives the gap between Taiwan’s 28 percent statutory rate and its 8 percent actual rate…

[Another] key driver of the gap is compliance with USMCA, the trade agreement between the United States, Mexico, and Canada that replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement in 2020. If a sufficient share of a shipment’s value was added inside the three economies, rather than imported into the bloc, the importer can typically declare the goods USMCA compliant and largely avoid tariffs.

A 14% tax is not an incredibly high rate. It’s

a very inefficient tax

, since it taxes intermediate goods instead of final goods. But it’s not that high of a rate. And imports themselves are not that big of a percent of the U.S. economy — only

about 14%

in 2024. 14% of 14% is only about 2%.

Raising taxes on the U.S. economy by 2 percentage points, even using an extremely inefficient tax, is unlikely to crush the economy — even when Americans are suffering most of the burden of the tax, as Gopinath and Neiman argue. And the U.S. economy is also getting lucky with the data center boom, which is

probably canceling out

a significant portion of the demand destruction from tariff-induced pessimism.

That having been said, the pain from tariffs may simply take a while to arrive. Via

Marginal Revolution

, I see that

Besten and Känzig have a new paper

studying the historical macroeconomic impact of U.S. tariffs. The authors look at historical tariff policy announcements, and feed these “shocks” into a model of the economy. This is a very imperfect way of studying the impact of tariffs, since the model might be wrong, and the “shocks” might be responding to economic conditions in ways the authors overlook. But the main upshot of the exercise is that most of the impact of tariffs on things like GDP happens after one or two years have passed:

It has only been eight months since “Liberation day”, so we will probably be revisiting this topic a year from now.

4. The U.S. government gets defrauded too often

A lot of ink is being (justifiably) spilled over the

Minnesota welfare fraud

, in which Somali communities defrauded the Medicaid system out of at least $250 million, and

as much as $18 billion

. But this is only the biggest and most audacious case of government fraud that has cropped up in recent years.

For example, few people noticed the $1.3 billion Medicare fraud perpetrated by

Philip Esformes

, who was pardoned by Donald Trump during his first term in office. California was recently found to be suffering from an epidemic of

fake community college applications

that siphoned millions in educational funds from the state. The food stamp (SNAP) system is defrauded of

hundreds of millions every year

. Florida’s school voucher system

reportedly has no idea

where thirty thousand “students” are. Much of this fraud occurs at the state level, where billions of dollars are spent each year with

minimal to no oversight

.

Unless it gets much worse, the defrauding of the U.S. government is unlikely to impose a significant economic cost on the country — even a few tens of billions of dollars over a decade won’t be missed in an economy that creates tens of

trillions

of dollars of value each year. (Note: A few investigators believe that Medicare and Medicaid fraud totals

up to $100 billion per year

. This

would

be economically significant.) But high-profile cases like these reduce trust in America’s institutions, so preventing them is very important.

Those who believe that the key is to simply elect Republicans will be sorely disappointed. The school voucher fraud shows how schemes designed to outsource government services are inherently vulnerable to fraud. Lots of this fraud could have been caught by having the government hire a lot more auditors, but the GOP tends to slash civil service positions and decrease state capacity. Right-wing schemes like DOGE have notably failed to find significant amounts of waste or fraud; it was the Biden administration that caught the Somali fraudsters in Minnesota. And of course, Donald Trump, who now presides over

by far the most corrupt administration

in American history, is willing to pardon notorious fraudsters like Esformes. In fact, one of the loudest voices calling for increased oversight of state spending programs is

Democrat Ro Khanna

.

Tighter auditing of state spending is just one example of how America needs a “trust offensive” — a comprehensive program to increase trust in U.S. institutions.

5. How to get rid of math anxiety (hint: teach people math)

In 2013, my PhD advisor Miles Kimball and I co-wrote a post called “

The Myth of ‘I’m Bad at Math

’”, in which we argued that de-emphasizing natural talent and emphasizing hard work would lead to improved math education. It remains one of the most popular things I’ve ever written.

I recently happened to see a paper that provides some concrete support for our argument.

Ng et al. (2022)

find that six weeks of intensive “remediation” — i.e., math tutoring — reduced math anxiety among Taiwanese kids by a considerable amount. The best way to make kids less anxious about math was simply to

teach them math and have them do math

.

It’s always risky cherry-picking a single paper that supports your priors. And it’s worth noting that the authors find that intensive training improves performance even for students who

don’t

report high initial math anxiety, which suggests that a lack of time spent on education, rather than anxiety, is probably responsible for a lot of American students’ shortfall in mathematics. But

meta-analyses

of math anxiety

remediation programs

find generally positive effects, so I still have confidence that Miles and my article from 2013 was on the money.

This is one more reason to believe that the progressive approach to math education is fundamentally wrong. Progressives have

consistently focused

on

dumbing down

math

education

in order to produce more “equitable” outcomes, resulting in worse education quality across the board. The success of various intervention programs in combatting math anxiety supports the notion that kids

are

educable, that math is

not

simply an IQ test, and that what’s needed instead is a culture of hard work and a willingness to invest in education.

6. China, land of robots

China is really big — about four times the size of the United States — which is why it now has the world’s biggest economy by many measures.

1

But having the biggest economy and being at the forefront of economic development are two very different things; China is still much poorer than developed nations. That gap won’t be closed for quite a while, if ever.

But despite the country’s lagging living standards, an increasing number of people now see China as the world’s most advanced nation. It may not have big houses and plentiful services, but China has the world’s most impressive infrastructure, and a tech industry that’s leading the world in many areas.

Central to China’s bid to be the “country of the future” is its mastery of an integrated suite of technologies that I call

the Electric Tech Stack

. The fundamental upstream technologies here are batteries, electric motors, and power electronics — the first two of which China utterly dominates. But we’re now starting to see what that mastery means in terms of downstream applications. The New York Times’ Keith Bradsher recently took a trip to China and

wrote a bit

about how electric technology is transforming life there:

[China is] rolling out fleets of autonomous delivery trucks, experimenting with flying cars and installing parking lot robots that can swap out your E.V.’s dying battery in just minutes. There are drones that deliver lunch by lowering it from the sky on a cable…

Hefei is one of the first Chinese cities to issue permits for what are basically flying cars. So I booked a ride…The two-seater is piloted remotely, not by someone sitting next to you…They can travel 25 minutes on a charge and go about 80 miles per hour…

Electric vehicles (including models with a tiny gasoline engine for extra range) have accounted for more than half of new-car sales in China every month since March. A subcompact can cost as little as $9,000…New models can charge in as little as five minutes…Essentially, China has turned cars into sophisticated rolling smartphones. Some have built-in karaoke apps so you can entertain yourself while your car does the driving…

We decided to eat in a city park…[W]e used a drone-delivery app to order a fried pork cutlet and a small omelet on fried rice…We returned to the park the next day and ordered soup…[T]he soup stayed warm despite its journey…

While a

few U.S. cities

have experimented with driverless cars, China leads in the number on the road and where they can operate…Wuhan is one of a dozen or more Chinese cities with driverless taxis. Hundreds

now roam

most of the city, serving the airport and other major sites…

We had enjoyed Hefei’s airborne lunches, but there’s a lot more autonomous delivery in that city than just food. China still has many intercity truck drivers, but is starting to replace them with robot trucks for the last mile to stores and homes…The trucks look strangely faceless. With no driver compartment in front, they resemble steel boxes on wheels…The trucks go to neighborhood street corners where packages are distributed to apartments by delivery people on electric scooters or a committee of local residents. Larger trucks serve stores.

Much of this story is about China’s regulatory climate. Undeterred by worries over job loss (especially in the face of an anticipated demographic decline starting in the 2030s), China is willing to approve things like drone delivery, driverless cars and trucks, and remote-operated air taxis that Americans and Europeans balk at.

Part of this is also a story about bank loans. Since 2022, China has tried to compensate for the bust in its real estate industry by pouring a flood of cheap loans into any tech industry deemed strategically important — and electric technology and autonomy are at the top of that list. So a lot of these companies doing drone delivery or self-driving trucks are playing with a huge amount of essentially free capital, like when Uber and Lyft were nearly free for Americans back in the mid-2010s.

But a lot of this is a pure technology story. China bet on batteries and electric motors in a way the rest of the world didn’t, and that bet is bearing fruit. Batteries and electric motors make energy fundamentally more portable, in more finely divisible quantities. Thus, a world of batteries and electric motors — coupled with rapid progress in AI, of course — is a world in which much of the “dumb matter” of the world around us starts to get up and walk around on its own.

China is eagerly rushing toward that robotic future while America and Europe

quake in fear of the unknown

and

revile the scientific and technological institutions

that once made our societies the envy of the world. There are many ways in which modern China is

not a society to be emulated

, but the country’s embrace of electric technology is a key way in which that country is now leading the rest of the world.

Part I: I want the Japanese future back!

Japan lost the future in 2008, not in 1990

When I lived in Japan in the mid-2000s, it still felt very much like “the future”. 3g flip-phones with grainy cameras were far more advanced than anything I had encountered in the U.S. Japanese people had LCD or plasma TVs, while most Americans were still using old cathode-ray machines. Their kitchens had automatic rice-cookers and other appliances I had never seen, and their laptops were higher-performance and far more durable than the ones I had used in the U.S. Their toilets were like something from a spaceship, and their showers could dry clothing. Some people even had digital SLR cameras that could shoot movie-quality video — a miraculous technology I had never even dreamed was possible.

And the cities! Giant screens adorned the sides of buildings, like something out of science fiction. There was always a train station within walking distance that would take me anywhere I wanted to go. The trains were clean and fast and they ran on time, and they even had electronic screens that told you when the train would arrive at the next station. Japanese cars and even motorcycles glided along quietly, where in America they roared and grumbled. Even in the U.S., of course, the most revolutionary, futuristic car — the Toyota Prius — was a Japanese model.

In the 21st century’s opening decade, Japan felt like it had embraced that new century while America was still lingering in the 20th. William Gibson, the celebrated creator of the cyberpunk science fiction genre,

wrote this

in 2001:

The world's second-richest economy, after nearly a decade of stagflation…still looks like the world's richest place, but energies have shifted…yet it feels to me as though all that crazy momentum has finally arrived…[T]onight, watching the Japanese do what they do here, amid all this electric kitsch, all this randomly overlapped media, this chaotically stable neon storm of marketing hoopla, I've got my answer: Japan is still the future, and if the vertigo is gone, it really only means that they've made it out the far end of that tunnel of prematurely accelerated change. Here, in the first city to have this firmly and this comfortably arrived in this new century - the most truly contemporary city on earth - the center is holding…Home at last, in the 21st century.

Now realize that the Japan of my earliest memories — the early and mid-2000s — was a full

decade and a half

after the famous bursting of Japan’s economic bubble. I am not hearkening back to the go-go days of the 1980s. By the time Koizumi Junichiro was in office, Japan’s “lost decade” had come and passed, full employment had been restored, and the country had returned to slow but steady economic growth. Despite the overhang of the bubble era, Japanese per capita incomes, measured at international price levels, grew by a respectable 20% between 1990 and 2007:

Our World in Data

This was slower than the U.S. or West Europe, but that was mainly due to Japan’s more rapid population aging, which was increasing the percentage of retirees. In terms of GDP per

worker

, Japan kept pace with other rich countries over this time period, and even outgrew the United States:

Source:

Our World in Data

And this growth was being felt by regular Japanese people. It wasn’t just fancy gadgetry and big screens. Japanese houses were getting steadily bigger, growing from the tiny “rabbit hutches” of the postwar period into something similar to what Europeans enjoyed:

Japanese people were eating better, too, as local chefs and entrepreneurs took advantage of imported food to create the world’s best restaurant scene, and big new grocery stores like Aeon revolutionized home cooking. Gyms, cafes, and all kinds of public spaces were improving in quality and quantity. Culturally, Japan still felt at the cutting edge, with a vibrant street fashion scene, a golden age of anime and manga, a burst of musical creativity, and an explosion of online culture driven by websites like Niconico.

Given all this, it’s reasonable to ask whether Japan’s so-called “lost decades” after the bubble era were really lost at all. Japan’s catch-up growth had ended, and its living standards were still a bit below the very richest countries like Switzerland or Singapore, but it was solidly within the first rank of nations, and it was still upwardly mobile. It was innovative and vital, at the cutting edge of both technology and culture. And it had accomplished all of this without the kind of deep wrenching disruptions that America experienced after its own real estate bust.

But in the years since 2007, it feels like that Japanese future has been lost. Living standards grew only 6.5% between 2007 and 2022.:

Source:

Our World in Data

And even that meager amount of growth was entirely due to increased labor input — women, old people, and young people going to work — rather than to productivity increases. In fact, Japanese workers produced

less

per hour in 2019 than in 2007, falling well behind other advanced nations:

Why did Japan stagnate starting in 2008? It’s not clear. Potential culprits include the global financial crisis,

1

the big earthquake and nuclear accident of 2011, the subsequent shutdown of nuclear power,

rapid aging

, the retirement of the Baby Boom generation, and the ramping up of Chinese competition. Perhaps it was all of these combined. But whatever the reason, 2008 was the turning point.

This doesn’t mean Japan has stagnated in every regard. Its big cities continue to build themselves up, and its restaurants and shops have continued to improve. But when I go back to Japan each year, I can clearly feel the loss of that futuristic vitality that I felt 17 years ago. Japan’s consumer electronics are no longer the cutting edge, having long ago been supplanted by Apple and various other brands. Its auto companies have been caught flat-footed by the switch to battery EVs, and are now — like most Western brands — are in danger of losing the global market to

innovative Chinese competitors

.

America’s household appliances have caught up and surpassed Japan’s — plenty of American homes now sport Instant Pots, air fryers, sous vide cookers, video doorbells, smart speakers, and so on. Japan still has much better toilets, and there have been some locally specific innovations such as better air purifiers. But for the most part, Japanese homes still feel like they’re stuck in 2007. And that’s not even considering furniture, which tends to be much higher-quality in the U.S.

This does not mean Japan is a

bad

place to live, or that it’s no longer a rich country. Far from it. In fact, the amenities of life — the safety and friendliness, the visual beauty, the infrastructure, the unparalleled retail experience, and so on — make it extremely pleasant in ways that richer countries often fail to match. And if, like me, you’re a foreigner with an American salary who works remotely and sets his own hours, Japan can feel like a paradise. (In fact, this will be important for my argument in a bit.)

But for average Japanese people, life in Japan is hard to afford. Average real wages have

actually decreased since 1996

:

Source:

Ito Takatoshi

The situation is actually

not quite that bad

, since it involves substantial composition effects — falling labor hours, the retirement of highly paid Baby Boomers, the entry of more part-time workers into the labor force, and so on. In fact, hourly wages have increased by a modest amount. And

the rise of women’s employment

since 2002 has taken some financial pressure off of many families by adding a second income, just as it did in the U.S. in the 1980s and 1990s.

But the shift to dual-income households can only happen once. Ultimately, stagnant productivity and low overall growth will continue to make life a slog for the average Japanese family. The weak yen, which is caused in part by Japan’s slow growth, will continue to make imports expensive. And as the percentage of the elderly continues to steadily increase, Japan’s working-age citizens will have to toil more and more simply to afford the same standards of living —

unless productivity can be raised

.

Because being “the future” isn’t just about having fancy gadgets and cool screens on buildings. Technological progress — the development of new products and better production processes — is the ultimate font of a nation’s quality of life. If Japan can reclaim the mantle of “the future” — if it can reach the technological cutting edge across a wider array of products — it can secure an easier, more fulfilling life for its people.

Ultimately that is why I want the Japanese future back.

Stagnation isn’t a criticism; it’s an opportunity

Before I start coming up with ideas and recommendations, I think I should talk a bit about how we ought to think about economic stagnation.

In the years after Japan’s asset bubble burst, lots of authors took the opportunity to publish very harsh criticisms of nearly every facet of Japan’s economy and society. An archetypical work in this genre is Alex Kerr’s

Dogs and Demons: The Fall of Modern Japan

, published in 2002, which is a laundry list of assorted complaints about Japanese policy and society. Some of those complaints were accurate, while others — such as the idea that Japan killed its tourism industry by developing its cities too much — now look laughable in hindsight.

Right or wrong, though, my sense is that broadsides like Kerr’s, while certainly heartfelt and well-meaning, are ultimately counterproductive. Among those who take the criticisms to heart, they create a feeling of general despair and helplessness. And among those who recognize the flaws in the critiques, they create a siege mentality; many become convinced that people who point out Japan’s economic struggles are “anti-Japan”. Either way, the result is a general pall of

pessimism

. And if there’s one thing Japan definitely has too much of, it’s pessimism.

Thus, my aim in this particular essay is not to criticize Japan’s corporate culture, government bureaucracy, cabinet policy, or general attitudes. Stagnation is a fact, but we shouldn’t see it as a failing of Japanese society. Instead, we should see it as an

opportunity

.

Japan is still a developed country, but the years of stagnation since 2007 have given it some of the advantages of a

developing

country. Being behind the technological frontier means that other countries have done much of the hard work of pioneering new products, new business methods, new production processes, and so on. This gives Japan the opportunity to play a bit of catch-up, which is always easier than advancing the frontier.

From the 1950s through the 1970s, as Japan strove to recover from postwar poverty and to catch up with the U.S., Japanese entrepreneurs in the electronics, automotive, and machine tool industries either licensed technology from more established American companies, used their published research results, or reverse-engineered their products. Today, there is no reason Japanese engineers and entrepreneurs can’t learn from Taiwanese and Dutch semiconductor companies, American AI and software companies, Chinese EV and battery companies, and so on — and then, eventually, surpass them.

Years of wage stagnation and the weak yen have also

given Japan

another developing-country advantage: low costs. This creates an opportunity for Japan to both attract investment from all over the world, and to increase exports. In fact,

both of these are already happening

on a limited scale, as Nikkei Asia’s Obayashi Hiroki reported in March 2024:

The depreciating yen is reviving Japan's appeal as a manufacturing hub for goods such as cosmetics, while the lower costs for exporters have bolstered the competitiveness of Japanese rice abroad…South Korea's Cosmax, a contract manufacturer for cosmetics companies, plans to start building its first plant in Japan…Japan is drawing interest from global companies looking for a cost-competitive place to manufacture…

[S]ome Japanese companies are maneuvering to take advantage of the shifting landscape…JVCKenwood, which controls the third-largest global share in professional wireless systems, has repatriated all U.S. capacity to Japan…Manufacturing costs have declined by 30% through lower costs for material and labor.

Another way to put this is that because Japan has fallen a bit behind many other rich countries in terms of productivity, it has the opportunity to experience a period of rapid growth as it catches back up to the frontier. Let’s do a quick calculation. Right now, France’s labor productivity is 61% higher than Japan’s, and grew at 1.26% year from 2009 to 2019. If Japan could catch up to France over the next three decades in terms of both the level

and

the growth rate of productivity, it means living standards would grow at around 2.86% per year — almost as fast as as in the bubble years of the 1980s. Regular Japanese people would feel like they’re getting richer every year, contributing to a feeling of optimism that has been absent from the country for too long.

Japanese people are far from poor by international standards, but they would certainly enjoy being wealthier. In the 1950s and early 1960s,

Japanese households reveled

in the chance to have washing machines, televisions, and refrigerators; in the following decade, it was cars, air conditioners, and color TVs. In the 2020s and 2030s, the next set of “sacred treasures” could be futuristic gadgets like electric cars, AI assistants, heat pumps,

battery-powered appliances

, or personal care robots. They could be simple things like bigger houses, cheaper elder care and child care, and more comfortable sofas. Or they could be something that hasn’t even been invented yet.

A wealthier Japan would also have the opportunity to take more time off of work and indulge in artistic and creative pursuits, like they did in the 1990s and early 2000s. The independent fashion, comics, music, film, art, and animation scenes could flower again. And with more of a cushion of wealth, independent auteurs could take more risks with their careers — the next Shiina Ringo, Kojima Hideo, or Watanabe Shinichiro shouldn’t have to spend their formative years working sixty hours a week at a restaurant just to make ends meet.

In my experience, analyses of Japan’s economic problems tend to ask “What went wrong?”. Was it the financial crisis of 2008, or was it the rise of China? Was it the shutdown of nuclear plants, or was it rapid aging? Was it Japan’s old-fashioned corporate culture, or was it government policy mistakes? And so on. But while the question of “What went wrong?” is certainly of interest to academics, in my mind it is not the question that we should be asking with regards to Japan’s economy right now. Instead, we should be asking

“What could go right?”

. What could we do right now, in order to make Japan richer?

This is the mindset of a young, hungry developing country. I believe that developed countries could benefit from more of this mindset, and few could benefit more than Japan. Economic growth isn’t something to be maintained out of fear of falling behind. It’s something to aspire to, so that tomorrow will be better than today. Japan now has more to aspire to, and that’s not a bad thing.

Forget about macroeconomics. It’s time for development economics.

When I think of what sort of strategies Japan could use to reclaim the future, I think about

development

rather than

macroeconomics

.

Macro policies are what a country uses when there’s a shortage of aggregate demand — idle workers and idle factories, waiting to be called into use. In a rich country, aggregate demand shortages are the main threat to growth. The tools to fight them are monetary easing (having the central bank buy bonds and other assets) and fiscal stimulus (government borrowing and spending).

In the 1990s, after Japan’s real estate bubble burst, the government used both of these policy tools to prevent unemployment from rising too high. And in the 2010s, former Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo and Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda Haruhiko used both of these policies to put more of the Japanese population to work.

Macroeconomic policies — mostly monetary policy — largely succeeded in boosting employment under Abe.

2

For most of Japan’s postwar history, between 67 and 70 percent of Japanese adults aged 15-64 were employed; under Abe that increased to 78%:

Source:

Federal Reserve Economic Data

Housewives and NEETs moved into the workforce, and people took fewer early retirements. In fact, many seniors in Japan

started working longer

into their golden years.

Abe and Kuroda’s macro policies put the nation to work. This is why Japan was able to eke out a 6.5% rise in GDP per capita between 2007 and 2022, despite zero productivity growth and rapid population aging. But this is the kind of achievement that can

only happen once

. Essentially everyone in Japan now has a job — there’s no one left to move into the workforce.

That means there’s no more scope for macroeconomic policies to help Japan grow. Obviously, full employment should be maintained, and future recessions will need to be fought. But if Japan is going to boost its people’s living standards into the top rank, it’s going to need

microeconomic

policy instead.

The standard tools of microeconomic policy are regulatory improvement, tax changes, and innovation policy. These will all be important for Japan. And I also believe that

industrial policy

— the practice of encouraging specific groups of industries, and even specific industries — will be important as well. Japan used the “

developmental state

” to great effect in its postwar miracle, and I believe this can help to produce another, smaller miracle today. But the development strategies that work in the 21st century are going to look different than what worked in the 20th.

Multi-strategy development: Try everything at once!

Outsiders have written two canonical, authoritative books about Japan’s postwar economic miracle. These are Chalmers Johnson’s

MITI and the Japanese Miracle

, and Bob Johnstone’s

We Were Burning: Japanese Entrepreneurs and the Forging of the Electronic Age

. These should always be read as a pair, because they reach almost exactly the opposite conclusions about why Japan succeeded from the 1950s through the 1980s.

Johnson believes that Japan’s secret sauce was the developmental state — in particular, the old Ministry of International Trade and Industry. He argues that it was Japan’s hyper-competent bureaucrats — selected from the best and the brightest, and motivated by a high-pressure “up-or-out” career path — who engineered Japan’s miracle. The key policies, as he sees it, were A) encouraging cheap finance to increase production for the domestic market, and B) controlling the flow of foreign exchange to encourage heavy industry, and later electronics.

Johnstone, by contrast, believes that MITI simply got in the way of Japan’s true source of growth: private entrepreneurs and inventors. He tells the stories of heroic engineers like Tadashi Sasaki, Iwama Kazuo, Kuwano Yukinori, and Nakamura Shuji, and the bold entrepreneurs who backed their ideas at companies like Sharp, Casio, Soney, and Stanley. Johnstone argues that by focusing on established companies instead of upstarts, MITI ignored or even hindered this historic wave of innovation.

Who is right, Johnson or Johnstone? The likeliest answer, given the many compelling stories that each author uses to make his case, is that

they’re both right

. Japan’s postwar miracle was not the triumph of a single “silver bullet” theory of development, but a multi-strategy effort. Even as bureaucrats were nudging big old Japanese companies toward the future, private entrepreneurs were doing their own thing. Occasionally these efforts came into conflict over scare resources, but in general they coexisted successfully; rapid productivity growth at home and access to global markets abroad meant that there was plenty of demand for the products of both types of companies.

In fact, this might not have been a happy accident, but an inherent advantage of multi-strategy development. The economists Ricardo Hausmann and César A. Hidalgo have

done research showing

that a nation’s economic

complexity

— the variety of different goods and services it produces — is a good predictor of its growth. Japan’s bifurcation into a government-directed big corporate sector and a more freewheeling entrepreneurial sector in the postwar years may have contributed to its economic success, since those two types of companies tend to address different markets and create different kinds of products.

In the end,

both

types of companies succeeded in the mid- to late 20th century — the Toyotas and the NECs of the world, and also the Sonys and the Sharps. Had either type had failed, Japan’s postwar miracle would have been weaker. Johnson and Johnstone have each grasped once piece of the proverbial elephant.

It’s very likely that the same principle holds true for developed countries. Consider the U.S., whose economy has done better than almost any other rich country in recent decades. Go down

the list

of the most valuable American companies, and you’ll see relative newcomers like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Google at the top. But scroll just a little farther down, and you’ll see older companies like Eli Lilly (founded 1876), Procter & Gamble (founded 1837), Johnson & Johnson (founded 1886), and General Electric (founded 1892).

Even the most entrepreneurial countries don’t replace most of their older firms; they simply add to the list. Apple and Google added huge value to the American economy, but they didn’t do it by replacing the likes of Eli Lilly or General Electric; instead, they opened up new markets and developed different kinds of products. A few of America’s old companies withered and died, but many succeeded in improving their operations, sustaining their innovation, adopting new technologies, modernizing their management styles, and continuously looking for their own new markets. Even Microsoft, which was a hard-charging startup just a few decades ago, recently had to reinvent itself as a cloud computing company in order to maintain its position.

The lesson here is that a successful development push shouldn’t put all its eggs in the basket of a single overriding theory. Because we don’t know in advance what will work, various approaches and models should be tried

in parallel

in order to improve productivity. Just as a basketball team needs both three-point shooters and “slashers” who drive to the paint, a country’s economy needs multiple ways to attack the problem of development.

Japan’s pincer attack against stagnation

In fact, there are signs that Japan is already beginning its industrial revival, and we can see at least two different strategies at work. Roughly speaking, these are A) revitalizing existing Japanese companies through changes in corporate governance, business strategy, and labor practices, and B) developing new companies by encouraging startups.

In her 2020 book

The Business Reinvention of Japan

, Ulrike Schaede argues that the first of these is going well. She explains how some large Japanese companies like FANUC, Mitsubishi Electric, and Fujifilm have streamlined themselves by selling off many non-core competencies, and how they’ve carved out defensible, profitable export niches for themselves by making high-tech components and materials. She cites policies like Japan’s new

Corporate Governance Code

and

Stewardship Code

, as well as former Prime Minister Abe Shinzo’s rhetorical focus on increasing corporate profits, as having contributed significantly to this revival. She also cites financial innovations like the JPX-Nikkei 400 stock index, which selectively highlights and promotes companies based on various measures of profitability.

There is some evidence to support Schaede’s view. Japan’s corporate profits have seen a revival since the early 2010s:

James Montier

As

James Montier

and other have pointed out, a lot of this has been from corporate deleveraging; operating profits, which give a better indication of a company’s long-term economic strength, have increased by a more modest amount. But the trend is definitely in the right direction!

And investors have recognized corporate Japan’s revival. The Nikkei 225 stock index has been on a tear recently,

outpacing other world stock markets

by quite a bit, and finally reattaining the heights of the bubble period:

Google

As Schaede and others have shown, much of this increase comes from

greater foreign demand

for Japanese stocks, meaning that the world is betting on Japan, Inc.

Meanwhile, although Japan no longer has a trade surplus, its exports have been rising:

Source:

World Bank

Meanwhile, signs of changes in Japan’s traditional corporate culture are starting to emerge. One key shift is the move away from lifetime employment toward mid-career hiring. Nikkei Asia

reports

:

Japanese companies will fill 37.6% of job openings with midcareer hires this fiscal year, a Nikkei study shows, the share representing the largest-ever shift away from Japan's traditional lifetime employment model…The ratio of midcareer hiring had hovered in the teens until fiscal 2017, then rose rapidly until topping 30% five years later.

So far, surveys suggest that a little over half of Japanese job-switchers are

happy with the outcome

.

Another big shift is the rise in female managers. Although Japan isn’t close to hitting the 30% target that former Prime Minister Abe set out, the number has steadily risen, and

stood at around 15% in 2021

.

Meanwhile, hybrid work is becoming more popular. According to

one recent survey

, over 70% of Japanese workers now work at least one day a week outside the office. This will probably help Japanese companies shift from a focus on work

inputs

to work

outputs

, since remote work inherently rewards completion of concrete tasks rather than the number of hours an employee sits at their desk. That will eventually help boost productivity.

Corporate Japan is slow to change, but it is changing.

This is all good, and should be counted as a success for Abenomics and for Japanese management. But so far the revolution in corporate profits, stock prices, and exports hasn’t been enough to revive real wages or productivity in the aggregate. Japan needs other strategies

in addition

to Schaede’s “aggregate niche” strategy.

In his 2023 book

The Contest for Japan’s Economic Future

, Richard Katz outlines a radically different strategy for Japan’s economic revival. He doubts that big corporations will ultimately be nimble enough to reinvent themselves en masse, noting that in the U.S., there’s high turnover among the biggest companies. Instead, he places his faith in high-growth startups, sometimes known as “gazelles”. He cites entrepreneurs like Minami Soichiro of the job-matching company

Visional

and Matsumoto Yasukane of B2B e-commerce platform

Raksul

, and the “intrapreneurial” corporate culture at Recruit, as examples of how innovative companies can carve out new business niches.

In fact, Japan’s venture-funded startup industry has been experiencing somewhat of a boom in recent years — although like most other countries, it

took a hit in 2022

.

Japan Investment Corporation

Kenji Kushida has

a good series of posts

at the Carnegie Endowment, explaining the changes in Japan’s startup ecosystem and its venture capital industry. He

points out

that although Japan’s VC industry trails the U.S. by a lot, it’s about equal in absolute size to that of Germany, the UK, South Korea, or France. He also shows that the world of startups is gaining more prestige, talent, and autonomy in Japan — independent VCs

are eclipsing

in-house corporate investors, founders are increasingly

being drawn

from the ranks of top universities and companies, and there are the beginnings of a virtuous cycle where successful founders become investors themselves.

But despite some very real improvement, Japan still has a lot of opportunity to increase entrepreneurship. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor shows Japan lagging many other rich countries in terms of total entrepreneurial activity as of 2022:

Source:

Global Entrepreneurship Monitor

Katz suggests a number of concrete policy changes that could encourage more high-growth startups — tax breaks for angel investors and LLCs, government procurement contracts for young companies, administrative guidance to increase bank loans to startups, policies to encourage

open innovation

, and so on. These are all ideas worthy of consideration, and wouldn’t be very hard to implement.

Katz also calls for government to rescue fewer failed companies with tax-funded bailouts — something

I’ve also long advocated

, and which

research shows is a problem

. In fact, the Japanese government has been moving in this direction:

Japan's government is willing to let more underperforming companies fail, three senior government officials told Reuters, a previously unreported acknowledgment that they said reflects an urgent need to replace sclerotic businesses with those able to deliver growth…The move will help Japan channel workers and investment to its most productive companies in a tight labor market, boosting wages, said the officials, granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.

There are plenty of ways to protect Japanese workers from these necessary changes. Japan is already developing a robust private equity industry and a culture of domestic M&A that helps preserve jobs by incorporating less successful Japanese companies into more successful ones. On top of that, Katz suggests the creation of a Danish-style

flexicurity system

to help individual workers, which sounds like a great idea.

Schaede and Katz have thus identified two very different approaches to Japan’s economic revival. And unsurprisingly, there is some disagreement between the two as to which model is better.

3

Interestingly, the two sides of the argument are much the same as between Johnson and Johnstone a generation earlier — Schaede places her faith in government policy that nudges big business toward the right markets and products, while Katz places his faith in independent entrepreneurs.

And just as with Johnson and Johnstone, it’s likely that both sides are correct. Yes, big old companies and fast-growing startups compete for resources like bank loans and engineers, and occasionally they even compete in product markets as well. But this competition is ultimately less important than how the two types of companies

complement

each other.

New Japanese companies will provide crucial inputs to older ones — to use two of Katz’ favorite examples, Visional and Raksul help older Japanese companies with hiring and purchasing, respectively. If Japan manages to build a software industry, Japanese manufacturers and service companies will likely be big beneficiaries. And so on.

Japan’s entrepreneurs will also be able to exploit export niches that older companies miss, because the initial market is too small. This is exactly what Sharp did with digital calculators and LCDs, what Seiko did with quartz wristwatches, and what Yamaha did with digital synthesizers. (These companies were not startups when they pioneered these famous products, but the principle is the same.) Sometimes the new products will

disrupt old companies’ business models

, but often they’ll just create new markets and add to Japan’s list of competencies.

Finally, new and old companies will be able to share ideas with each other — innovations in management, production techniques, marketing leads, physical technologies, and so on — via the boom in mid-career hiring. Employees

take their knowledge with them

when they move. Startups can hire people from big companies who are too restless, disaffected, or ambitious to work their way up the corporate ladder. And big companies can hire employees from startups who are looking for a more secure paycheck, bigger research budgets, and a larger support staff. In a way, mid-career hiring and open innovation can make a whole industry, a whole city, or even a whole country into one large keiretsu.

But there’s a third group of companies that can be incredibly useful to this process. And they represent a third strategy for Japan’s economic redevelopment, which the writers I mention above — as brilliant as they are — don’t really discuss. I’m talking about

foreign companies and foreign entrepreneurs who use Japan as a base for production

.

Already we can see this third strategy start to materialize. The first place to look is Kumamoto.

Part II: FDI is the missing piece of Japan’s puzzle

The Kumamoto miracle points the way

The semiconductor industry is probably the most important industry in the world. Computer chips are absolutely essential to every high-value product in a modern economy — autos, rockets, appliances, machinery, everything. They’re also of crucial military importance, in an age where precision weaponry rules the battlefield. And they’re of core importance to emerging technologies like AI — whose vast computational resources require enormous data centers — and biotech.

As a result, it’s no wonder that the world’s major economies have been fighting over the semiconductor industry

for generations

. In the early days, the U.S. and Japan were the clear leaders. Much of the industry involves the design of semiconductors and the production of specialized tools and materials, and in these upstream parts of the industry the U.S. and Japan are still strong. But in the most important downstream part of the process — the actual fabrication of the most advanced chips — both the U.S. and Japan have

lost their lead to Taiwan

:

Source:

Statista

Specifically, they have lost their lead to one remarkable Taiwanese company: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.  TSMC are essentially the world’s greatest machinists. Other companies design the chips, and other companies create the (incredibly advanced) machine tools that make the chips. What TSMC does is to buy the tools, and then use the tools with incredible ingenuity and efficiency to make someone else’s chips designs into reality. They pioneered this “pure-play foundry” business model, and it has made them rich — and it has allowed Taiwan to outcompete the chipmaking industries of every other country on the planet.

Since the pandemic, the global battle to win semiconductor market share has intensified, due to the advent of AI and to the geopolitical competition between China and the democratic countries. Japan, like many countries, is trying to build its own foundry business, in the form of

Rapidus

, a joint venture between a bunch of Japanese companies that’s also getting some help from IBM. But — also like in the U.S. there’s also a second, parallel effort afoot. Japan is building chips for TSMC.

In late 2021, TSMC created a Japanese subsidiary called Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing (JASM), and started building two fabs in Kumamoto prefecture. Sony and Denso pitched in to help. So did the Japanese government, providing

billions of dollars in subsidies

and offering TSMC logistical assistance in finding local workers and ensuring adequate water and other infrastructure. The first plant was completed very quickly, and

opened in February 2024

; the second is expected to open in 2025. Now TSMC is

considering a third fab

in Kumamoto, producing even more advanced chips, to be opened in 2030.

Observers have been impressed with the speed with which the fab was built,

comparing it favorably

to TSMC’s plant in America, which initially suffered delays.

4

TSMC

credited

the successful construction to a variety of local supporting institutions — “suppliers, customers, business partners, government and academia.” TSMC’s founder Morris Chang, who once

poked fun at Japan

for the slow speed of its business dealings, has now become a true believer in the revival of the country’s chip industry. At the opening of the first TSMC plant in Kumamoto,

Chang predicted

a “renaissance of semiconductors” in Japan.

And Japan isn’t stopping with TSMC. Micron, an American chip company, is

building a fab in Hiroshima

, bringing some of its best technology into the country.

5

Samsung is building

a semiconductor development center in Yokohama. Both of these investments are being done with significant help from the Japanese government, and involve cooperation with Japanese companies and universities.

These investments by foreign companies

aren’t Japan’s only strategy

for reviving its semiconductor industry — they coexist alongside homegrown efforts like Rapidus, as well as Japan’s upstream efforts in the chipmaking tool and materials industries. But they represent a crucial

addition

to the purely indigenous efforts. This is an example of multi-strategy development at work.

But it’s far from the only such example.

A school of AI fish

The artificial intelligence boom is the most important trend in the software industry right now. Whether this remains true in future years remains to be seen, of course, but the capabilities of large language models like ChatGPT, AI art software like Midjourney, and computer vision systems are undeniable. Even if there’s a bubble and bust in the field at some point — as there was with dot-com companies in 2000 — AI is going to be important in the long term.

Japan largely missed out on the internet software boom — the country has no internationally dominant consumer internet giants like Google or Facebook, and its B2B software industry was hampered by Japanese companies’ slowness to adopt IT solutions in past decades. But the AI age is a new dawn, and Japan has another shot at building a powerful software industry.

At the time of this writing, one of the most interesting AI startups in Japan is

Sakana AI

. Currently, AI applications generally use one large statistical model to generate text, create images, recognize objects, predict the shape of a protein, etc. Sakana tries to instead use groups of smaller models to accomplish the same thing. In addition to being able to do some things better than big models, these groups of smaller models may use much less electric power — an important consideration, when AI’s energy needs are skyrocketing.

Sakana AI has three founders. There’s Llion Jones, originally from Wales, who was one of the authors of the groundbreaking

2017 research paper

that discovered the algorithm now used to make LLMs. There’s David Ha, originally from Canada, who was an AI researcher at Google Brain. And there’s Ito Ren, a Japanese former diplomat who was an executive at the e-commerce company Mercari.

The company’s investors are equally international — it includes American venture capital firms like Khosla Ventures, Lux Capital, and New Enterprise Associates, the American semiconductor giant Nvidia, and a large assortment of Japanese banks and technology companies. Sakana’s most recent funding round raised $214 million, and valued the company at $1.5 billion.

That’s not a huge valuation compared to U.S. giants like OpenAI (

$150 billion

) or Anthropic (possible valuation of

$40 billion

). But Sakana’s presence has put Japan on the map as a potential hotspot for international AI investment. Nvidia, for example, has declared its intention to

create an R&D center

in Japan. OpenAI has opened

a branch office in Tokyo

. Oracle is

investing $8 billion

over the next decade in AI and cloud computing in Japan. This is in addition, of course, to all the big cloud providers — Amazon, Microsoft, and Google — looking to

invest in Japan

in order to serve the Japanese market.

Then there’s

Spellbrush

, a U.S. startup that has

a partnership

with the AI art and design company Midjourney. Spellbrush uses generative AI to create Japanese-style anime art — one of the most popular and lucrative applications for AI so far. Spellbrush recently opened a branch office in Tokyo’s Akihabara neighborhood.

Japan is still behind the U.S. and China in AI, but investments like these keep it in the game.

It’s important to note that although Sakana AI might succeed,

the most likely outcome is that the company will fail

. This is true because

most startups fail

in general, and because in a rapidly changing new industry like AI, the failure rate is likely to be even higher. In fact, the entire AI industry may be headed for

a significant bust

, like the dotcom crash in 2000.

But this shouldn’t negate the importance of Sakana, or of the Japanese AI boom in general. First of all, though most startups fail, the few that succeed often grow very large and important — venture investing is about accepting many failures in order to find a few huge wins. The investment and attention that Sakana draws to the Japanese AI startup scene will help make sure that some of those successes happen in Japan. Even a general AI bust will likely only be a temporary setback to the industry, as with the dotcom crash and the subsequent recovery.

Second, even failed startups often contribute crucial innovation to a country’s ecosystem. Fairchild Semiconductor wasn’t successful, but it pushed the envelope of semiconductor technology forward, and some of its alumni went on to

found Intel

. General Magic tried and failed to invent the smartphone in the 1990s, but its alumni went on to

help create the iPhone

.

And third, Sakana sends a signal that Japan is a viable destination for international investment in the software industry in general, well beyond AI. Japan is generally weak in most areas of IT, including B2B solutions, consumer internet companies, and cloud computing providers. As in semiconductors, a wave of foreign entrepreneurs and foreign funding could help Japan shore up its weak spot in software.

The most important kind of FDI

The chipmaking projects by TSMC, Micron, and Samsung, the U.S. VCs’ investment in Sakana AI, and the branch offices of companies like OpenAI are all examples of

foreign direct investment

, or FDI. But they’re not the only type, and when people talk about FDI, they often mean something very different. In fact, it’s actually a bit of a confusing term, because it encompasses multiple unrelated categories of investment.

6

FDI includes:

Cross-border real estate purchases

Acquiring a foreign company (M&A)

Building a branch office or factory in a foreign country (“greenfield” investment)

Most writers who advocate for Japan to increase FDI focus on the second of these. They believe that allowing more foreign acquisition of Japanese companies will improve these companies’ productivity by transferring foreign management techniques.

I am agnostic concerning this argument. I recognize that Japan’s policymakers and businesses have many reasons for

resisting foreign acquisitions

, both as part of the country’s development strategy and part of its social policy. Foreign buyers might downsize Japanese companies by firing large numbers of employees, which would hurt Japan’s corporation-centric social welfare model. They might strip-mine Japanese companies for their technology or other assets and then sell them off as husks of their former selves, as happens

all too often

with leveraged buyouts in the United States. Or they might simply neglect their Japanese acquisitions until they stagnated.

Instead, my argument is that Japan should focus specifically on increasing and promoting

greenfield FDI

— foreign companies building their own branch offices and factories in Japan. And in particular, Japan should encourage

greenfield platform FDI

, in which a foreign company builds factories or offices in Japan in order to create goods and services that are then exported from Japan to a third country. TSMC’s chip fabs in Kumamoto are an example of greenfield platform FDI.

This particular kind of FDI offers a lot of benefits that foreign takeovers don’t. For one thing, greenfield FDI usually directly adds to the economy — when a foreign company builds a factory in Japan, or even just purchases office equipment for a new office, that represents real money that goes directly into Japanese people’s pockets. And greenfield FDI inevitably results in the hiring of more Japanese workers, since someone has to work at the new factory or office branch.

Investment spending and workers’ salaries in turn stimulate the surrounding local economy — already, Kumamoto is experiencing

an economic boom

. Note that M&A doesn’t necessarily accomplish any of this — it just changes ownership of existing businesses, without requiring any new investment, hiring, or spending on the local economy.

And greenfield FDI is also more likely to be received warmly by the Japanese public.

Ito, Tanaka, and Jinji (2023)

find that Japanese people feel more positively about greenfield FDI than about foreign acquisitions:

This study empirically examines the determinants of individuals’ attitudes about inward foreign direct investment (FDI) using responses from questionnaire surveys that were originally designed. Individuals’ preferences for inward FDI differ between greenfield investments and mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and people are more likely to have a negative attitude toward M&A than greenfield investments. People with a negative image of the so-called “vulture fund” for foreign capital tend to oppose inward FDI, and this is more pronounced for M&A than greenfield investments.

On top of all this, greenfield platform FDI has a very good economic track record. It has been key to the economic success of a number of developing countries — most notably China, but also

Poland and Malaysia

.

After China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, companies from around the world flocked there to set up factories — both to sell their products to a billion newly available Chinese consumers, but also to exploit what at the time were cheap Chinese labor, land, energy, and capital costs, in order to make products for export to the rest of the world. This is known as “platform FDI”.

Poland executed a similar strategy on a smaller scale, becoming a factory floor for European nations — especially Germany — looking for lower costs and more friendly regulation. Malaysia became a center of electronics manufacturing, with investments from the U.S., Singapore, Japan, and elsewhere. In both of these cases, the products of foreign-owned factories were largely sold abroad, since both Poland and Malaysia have relatively small domestic markets. FDI thus helped to make China, Poland, and Malaysia into export powerhouses.

Japan, of course, is in a very different economic situation than China, Poland, or Malaysia were in the 2000s. But it can still learn from their successes. In addition to the direct benefits for investment and employment, greenfield platform FDI offers two main advantages: it can increase a country’s

exports

, while also facilitating

technology transfer

. In its current economic situation, Japan could use a whole lot of both of these things.

Japan needs exports

Americans often think of Japan as an export powerhouse, because of the international success of brands like Toyota, Honda, Sony, and Panasonic. And during the early days of the postwar miracle, Japan’s bureaucracy did strongly encourage exports, in order to earn precious foreign currency. But in fact, this lingering stereotype is badly mistaken — Japan has never really been an export-oriented economy like Germany or South Korea. It’s a domestically focused economy, more like the United States:

Source:

World Bank

As Chalmers Johnson recounts in

MITI and the Japanese Miracle

, this inward focus was part of Japan’s development model in the 1960s. MITI found that ensuring cheap bank loans to domestic companies, and promoting competition in the domestic market, was a way to quickly boost Japan’s investment rate and its capital stock. And they found that this approach also ensured an adequate level of exports, since Japanese companies would produce more than they could sell in the domestic market, and export the excess capacity overseas.

7

Now, Japan finds itself badly in need of exports. The first reason is that

exports help increase the value of the yen

, making Japanese people richer as a result.

Japan’s currency has weakened dramatically against the dollar and other world currencies. This is partly because of Japan’s low interest rates relative to other rich countries, which is driven by Japan’s low inflation (and probably by a need to keep Japanese government borrowing costs low, in order to make Japan’s very large government debt sustainable).

As a result of the weak yen, Japanese people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford imports. Japan imports most of its food and energy, so the weak yen is increasing the cost of daily life. Japanese companies are having trouble importing the parts and materials they need, as well as energy. The Japanese government has been

forced to intervene

to prop up the value of the yen. But such interventions can’t last forever, since they require selling off foreign assets — eventually, the government runs out of foreign assets to sell, and the currency crashes even more.

An increase in global demand for Japanese exports can help increase the value of the yen.

8

This is because in order to buy Japanese goods and services, foreigners need to swap their currencies for yen. This increases the demand for the yen, which pushes up its value. The more exports Japan sells, the stronger the yen becomes. Ultimately, Japan’s currency problem probably can’t be fixed by exports alone — financial outflows will have to be addressed as well. But exports help.

The second reason for Japan to focus on exports is that the domestic Japanese market is shrinking. Japan’s population is forecast to fall substantially over the remainder of this century:

Source:

Our World in Data

Mass immigration may slow this trend, and measures to increa

se the birth rate may eventually manage to reverse it. But whether that will ever happen is unknown, and even if it does, Japan will not be a major growth market for a long while. This means there is much less incentive for companies — Japanese or foreign — to invest in Japan in order to serve the domestic market than in the past. Less investment also means less spending on R&D, which causes Japan to fall behind technologically.

Exporting can help reduce this problem, or even solve it. The more Japan becomes an attractive platform for export production, the more reason there is for Japanese companies and foreign companies to invest in Japan, including investments in R&D and new technologies. This will help increase productivity.

Finally, the activities required to increase exports may improve productivity. There’s

a lot of research

on “learning by exporting” — entering foreign markets could teach Japanese engineers, product designers, and managers how to produce things that foreigners want to buy. This could help counter the so-called “

Galapagos syndrome

” — the tendency of Japanese product standards to drift away from international standards, shrinking the markets available to Japanese companies.

Another way to put this is that exporting allows companies based in Japan — whether domestically owned or foreign-owned — to achieve

scale

without exacerbating

competition

that drives down prices.

Greenfield platform FDI — like TSMC’s fabs in Kumamoto or American venture capitalists’ investment in AI startups in Tokyo — can help Japan become more of an export powerhouse.

Okubo, Wagner, and Yamada (2017)

find that foreign-owned factories in Japan tend to export more — and also to innovate more. Their explanations for the difference have to do with corporate governance and culture, and with the pool of employees that foreign-owned companies are able to hire. They write:

Foreign ownership may play a role in risk-taking choices of companies – such as exporting and innovating – for various reasons. It can provide companies with more information about the outside market, especially in the context of small and medium enterprises. Foreign owners may be keen on getting high returns on investment and may tolerate a higher risk level. Firms with foreign ownership may have greater access to funds. Also, firms that do allow foreign ownership may experience a more open corporate culture than firms that do not, and such open culture may facilitate risk-taking.

The simplest explanation here is that multinational companies — especially those with foreign employees — simply know a lot more about global markets. TSMC knows what kind of computer chips Nvidia and Apple want to buy. Sakana AI’s founders keep in touch with the American AI market, and understand what kind of capabilities U.S. companies want from AI models. And so on.

In other words, greenfield platform FDI is a perfect example of

multi-strategy development

. It means that instead of coming into Japan to compete with local companies in the Japanese market, foreign companies are helping Japan sell a bunch of new products to a bunch of new overseas customers.

The intangible benefits of FDI

Japan’s low levels of productivity are somewhat of a mystery to researchers.

Nakamura, Kaihatsu, and Yagi (2018)

, a trio of researchers from the Bank of Japan, arrive at the frustrating conclusion that the biggest problem is a lack of “intangible assets” at Japanese companies. These are any non-physical assets — brand reputation, patents, software, long-term customer relationships, management know-how, worker skills, tacit technical know-how, and so on.

This is such an enormously broad and heterogeneous category, and so many of its components are hard to measure, that “intangible assets” basically ends up becoming a label for economists’ ignorance about what makes some companies more valuable than others. For example, Nakamura et al. note that Japanese companies

spend quite a lot

on R&D, but don’t seem to get nearly as much value for their spending as U.S. companies do.

So the mystery remains a mystery. But even if we don’t quite know what the most important intangible assets are, we still might be able to help companies get more of them. Nakamura et al. suggest a fairly standard, reasonable list of approaches — increasing labor mobility, improving corporate governance, allowing more lagging companies to fail, and improving the venture capital ecosystem. These are all reasonable approaches, and — as we saw above — they’re all things that Japan is already trying to some greater or lesser degree.

But there’s one strategy that seems to be flying a bit under the radar here: FDI. When foreign companies put their factories, offices, and research centers in Japan, they bring many intangible assets with them — foreign management techniques, technical tricks and know-how, connections to customers and suppliers in other countries, and so on. And these can, for the most part, be pretty easily

transferred

to Japanese companies.

One way, which has been

thoroughly documented by researchers

, is through interactions with local suppliers. When a company like TSMC puts a semiconductor fab in Japan, one reason is so that it can buy a bunch of specialized tools and components from Japanese suppliers — like the photoresist that Japanese companies are so famous for. This in turn teaches Japanese suppliers what the leading chip companies need and how to best serve them, as well as details about how the best chipmaking tools work. Those kinds of knowledge are both intangible assets.

Another way ideas spread is through job-switching. TSMC’s fab is going to employ a bunch of Japanese workers. Those workers are going to get the chance to learn how to make chips from the very best in the business. If some of them eventually leave to go work at Japanese semiconductor companies, they’ll take all that knowledge with them. This sort of knowledge transfer would have been harder in the old days, when Japan was still under the lifetime employment system. But now, with mid-career hiring on the rise, it’s very likely.

Let’s imagine an example of how this might work. Suppose you’re a Japanese AI researcher at a domestic AI startup. You and your team know a lot about AI models, from reading research papers, from building them yourself, and maybe from going to some conferences overseas. But for some reason your models aren’t quite as good as foreign companies’ models. The foreigners must have a bunch of little tricks they use to make things work better.

Then one day your company hires another researcher who worked at Sakana AI. Your new colleague knows a lot of those tips and tricks for making models work more smoothly, from having worked with some of the top researchers at Sakana. And their time at Sakana also gave them personal connections with a bunch of other researchers overseas, whom you can now call up and ask for help solving your model’s problems.

Congratulations! You’ve just transferred tacit knowledge for free. Your company’s intangible assets have increased.

If this example sounds contrived, consider how many of Japan’s most famous inventions came through interaction with foreigners and absorption of foreign knowledge. Japan’s Canon

cooperated

with America’s Hewlett Packard in the 1980s to create laser printers. Yamaha

created

the digital synthesizer with the help of a Stanford engineer named John Chowning. The famous inventor Sasaki Tadashi licensed American patents to help him invent the first commercially viable pocket calculator.

Those are all examples from the book

We Were Burning

. In other words, in the 20th century, close links between Japan and the U.S. created a vibrant international research community, where ideas flowed back and forth across borders and across companies.

In fact, there’s evidence that this is a consistent pattern when it comes to FDI.

Todo (2006)

and

Kozo (2006)

both find that FDI consistently leads to positive productivity spillovers to the country that receives the investment, and that these spillovers are closely related to R&D spending.

Observers of the Japanese economy have noted with dismay how it seems to be losing human contact with other developed economies. Few Japanese people

study abroad

these days, and those that do tend to go only for a very

short period of time

. The number of Japanese young people who want to work abroad

has diminished

. Collaboration between Japanese scientists and their foreign counterparts

has decreased

, contributing to

a decline

in Japan’s high-quality research output. Even as the international research community has grown larger, Japan has been pulling away from it.

Greenfield FDI can help counter that increasing insularity, by bringing foreign researchers and managers into Japan, where Japanese people can absorb their knowledge without leaving the country.

Japan is welcoming the right kind of FDI, but it can do more

Why has greenfield FDI in Japan traditionally been very small? In the early days of its postwar miracle, Japan restricted all kinds of FDI for protectionist reasons, in order to reserve the domestic market for Japanese companies that were still in their early growth stages. This was a typical policy for the time, and not dissimilar from the “infant industry” protections used by the U.S. in its early development.

From the late 1960s through the early 1970s, Japan

significantly liberalized

its restrictions on FDI. There were still many institutional barriers to foreign acquisitions, mostly resulting from a combination of Japan’s financial and corporate governance systems, and from cultural resistance. But although foreign companies should, in theory, have had an easier time doing greenfield M&A from the 1970s onward, few took the plunge. There are lots of possible reasons for this — force of habit, regulatory differences between countries, cultural differences, and a general stereotype of Japan as a protectionist economy. But the most important reason was probably that unlike countries like China, Poland, or Malaysia, Japan simply didn’t try to

actively encourage

foreign companies to use it as a production base.

Since 2003, though, the situation has slowly changed. Former Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro

called for more FDI

into Japan. Regulations were eased a bit, and tax incentives were put in place. These efforts were minor and halting at first, but have gathered strength over time. Targets have become much more ambitious — in 2023 the government set a goal of

attracting 100 trillion yen of FDI

(about $690 billion as of this writing) by 2030.

Politicians

now talk regularly about the need to boost FDI. Immigration laws

have been changed

to make it much easier for skilled professionals to get permanent residency. There is a new Council for the Promotion of Foreign Direct Investment in Japan, and various other

government efforts to attract FDI

.

10

And amazingly, the plan seems to be working. In 2022, net FDI inflows to Japan were very slightly greater as a proportion of the economy than in either China or South Korea:

Our World in Data

And encouragingly, greenfield FDI seems to be powering this rise. The number of inbound M&A deals has

held steady

, while greenfield projects have soared:

Source:

JETRO

And since the semiconductor industry is powering this rise, it’s likely that a significant amount of this will result in exports.

But although this is good progress, Japan could do a lot more on the FDI front. First of all, 1.1% of GDP per year is a big improvement, but it’s not really big enough to be transformational —

Poland gets over 5%

, France gets 3.8%, and the U.S. gets 1.5%.

Second, most of Japan’s greenfield FDI is in one single industry — semiconductors. If Japan could attract similar levels of investment in other sectors, it would be insured against a sudden downturn in the chip industry, and it would have the chance to build up its technological muscle along a wider front. There are plenty of other high-value industries where Japan could be a high-tech, low-cost production platform — aerospace, biopharma, batteries, and electronics being four obvious examples.

In other words, Kumamoto, Sakana AI, and the other examples above are an important proof of concept for a golden age of Japanese FDI, but they should be only the beginning.

Why do foreigners invest in Japan?

Traditionally, the reason a few foreigners wanted to invest in Japan — either through greenfield investments or M&A — was to tap the large and lucrative Japanese market. That motivation still remains to some extent, but it’s growing weaker every day. But there are a number of reasons Japan is

increasingly attractive

as an export platform. Understanding these reasons is absolutely crucial for Japanese government officials and businesspeople who want to attract more FDI — if you’re selling something, you must understand why your customers want to buy it.

The most obvious selling point is the weak yen. A cheap Japanese currency makes anything produced in Japan more competitive in world markets. On top of that, decades of stagnant real wages have a silver lining — they’ve made Japan’s skilled workforce look relatively cheap. A third strong point is Japan’s deep network of high-quality suppliers.

There’s also the national security angle. As China’s foreign policy has become more aggressive, the U.S. and other developed nations have begun to try to move them out of China. The U.S. government calls this “friendshoring”, while companies call it “de-risking”, but the principle is the same — no one wants to be caught dependent on Chinese manufacturers for critical high-tech products if a war breaks out.

11

Japan is

an obvious alternative

production base — it’s smaller and more expensive than China, but infinitely more secure. And unlike China, Japan will not

use espionage

to steal foreign companies’ intellectual property.

Even Germany, which has traditionally been more willing than other Western countries to invest in China, is beginning to get nervous; a significant number of German companies are

looking to switch to Japan

. And the U.S. Department of Defense is planning to

develop

advanced

weapons

in Japan, as well as manufacturing more

traditional munitions

there.

Yet another advantage — which Japanese people may not fully appreciate, since they’ve never had to deal with the alternative — is Japan’s efficient government. In many Western countries,

environmental review laws

and other poorly crafted regulations have turned land use into a nightmare — projects that pass all relevant environmental and safety regulations still have to endure years of lawsuits and court-enforced paperwork, making it hellishly expensive and time-consuming to build factories.

The U.S.

,

the UK

, and other anglophone countries, which rely on the courts to adjudicate environmental regulation, have become especially hostile to development.

Japan’s more sensible and efficient system, which relies more on bureaucrats than on the court system, preserves some role for community input, but allows construction projects to be approved in a timely manner. Japan’s willingness to build, meanwhile, has left it with plenty of high-quality infrastructure — and the ability to create more quickly to suit the needs of foreign investors if necessary.

But there’s one more huge reason that foreigners want to invest in Japan, which could ultimately be more important than all the rest combined. And it’s a factor that, in my experience, very few Japanese people — including the government officials tasked with

promoting FDI

— yet appreciate.

The key is that

people around the world really love Japan, and want to live there

.

Part III: Why everyone loves Japan

The world loves everything Japanese, but Japan doesn’t realize it

In 2015, my employers at Bloomberg Opinion sent me to Japan to learn about the state of the Japanese economy. They helped me arrange many interesting discussions. I talked to the Financial Services Agency about the new corporate governance code; to Goldman Sachs about women joining the workforce; to Foreign Ministry officials about trade treaties; to an economics professor about fiscal sustainability; and so on. But the interview that stuck in my mind for many years after was with a manager at Kodansha.

My goal for the meeting was to learn about Japan’s efforts to increase its cultural exports — something the Western press had been talking about

for decades

. So I was absolutely astonished when the Kodansha manager told me that his company had no strategy and no plans to increase their sales of manga and anime in overseas markets. Even more surprising was his explanation as to why. “Americans don’t want to see Asian faces,” he told me.

I stared at him in slack-jawed amazement. Nothing could be further from the truth, I told him. I didn’t have international statistics on hand, but I knew that Asian media was taking the U.S. by storm. Manga sections were steadily

growing in American bookstores

. K-pop was

exploding in popularity

. Cosplay conventions had become mainstream. Overseas anime sales were starting their long upward climb:

Association of Japanese Animations

In 2015, these trends were already becoming apparent, but they’ve only accelerated. From the TV show

Shogun

sweeping the 2024 Emmy Awards, to the Korean film

Parasite

winning the Oscars in 2020, to Oscars for the Japanese movies

Godzilla Minus One

and

The Boy and the Heron

, to Korea’s BTS becoming

the biggest band in the world

, there has been no shortage of proof that “Asian faces” — or, more precisely, the products of Japanese and Korean imaginations — are

exactly

what the world wants to see.

But these examples can’t fully convey how Japanese pop culture, in particular, has become a memetic shorthand that young generations in America and many other countries use to communicate, to define themselves, and to understand the world.

When I moved to a new apartment last year, the movers stopped to talk to me about anime. When I went to hang out with some venture capitalists at their lavish San Francisco apartment, they asked me if I wanted to watch some anime. When I tutored children in math as a college student back in the 2000s, it was hard to get the kids to pay attention, because they were drawing anime characters in their notebooks. Anime tropes like “Notice me, senpai!” have crept into the American lexicon. When I go to my friends’ startup offices, there are manga volumes on the shelves. When I argue with strangers online, their avatars are faces from anime.

These aren’t just anecdotes.

A survey

of Americans by the website Polygon in early 2024 found that 42% of Gen Z watches anime every week, compared to just 25% who watch the NFL. Younger survey respondents reported that anime influences many basic aspects of their life — style, identity, friendship, and even attraction. (That’s just in the U.S., but as far as I know, this trend is worldwide — anime viewership is

growing even faster

in Europe, Brazil, and the Anglosphere.)

In fact, the increasing Japanese influence on American life goes far beyond pop culture. Over the past two decades, Japanese food has increasingly become the most sought-after cuisine. New Yorkers

line up around the block

to get into ramen restaurants that would be considered average in Japan. Wagyu has become a

national obsession

.

12

Omakase has become

a pinnacle of find dining

, and words like

kaiseki

and

izakaya

are becoming part of the standard lexicon. Matcha has become a delicacy — expensive shops

advertise

“the finest matcha tea from the shade-grown farms of Kyoto, Japan”. Even non-Japanese restaurants

sometimes affect

Japanese names and pseudo-Japanese decor in order to seem higher class — allowing to charge a hefty price premium. It’s hard to find a high-end cafe or restaurant in San Francisco these days that doesn’t have something yuzu-flavored.

Nor is it just food. In the high-end home furnishing stores where rich Americans shop, Japanese-made ceramics and other objects command a hefty price premium. At the more affordable end, Daiso, Uniqlo, and Muji have become all the rage. Japanese artists like Kusama Yayoi have become such staples of high culture that the trend has been

parodied in Netflix dramas

. Fashionistas in trendy cafes will have

B-side Label

stickers on their laptops and bags.

As with food, even the veneer of Japanese fashion and design is enough to impart a sense of high class and good taste. Seeing boutiques with katakana on their signs on St. Mark’s Place in New York City, or Haight Street in San Francisco, is now commonplace, even if the goods inside aren’t from Japan.

13

Trendy American brands will give themselves Japanese-inspired names like “

Baggu

”. I often joke that the U.S. is in the middle of a great shift — in the 19th and 20th centuries, high class in America was defined as “anything French”, while in the 21st century it’s defined as “anything Japanese”.

Japan’s international cachet can be seen in a variety of international surveys and rankings. In 2023, Japan topped the

Anholt-Ipsos Nation Brands Index

, which has measured international perceptions of various developed countries for 15 years:

Japan also regularly comes in

at or near the top

of a similar international survey by the BBC. Recently,

Japan was ranked #2

on U.S. News and World Report’s list of the “best countries in the world”, which combines various subjective metrics to assess a country’s international appeal. And another survey by Conde Nast

put Japan in the top spot

.

In my experience, most Japanese people are generally unaware of any of this. Earth became a weeb planet in spite of

the failure

of the Japanese government’s attempts to promote Japanese culture overseas. It has been an organic, disorganized, bottom-up phenomenon — Japanese culture simply holds a special appeal to the people of the U.S. and much of the rest of the world.

The most important word about Japan that Japanese people don’t know

In fact, even more astonishing than my interview with Kodansha is the fact that to this day, I have not met a single Japanese person who has heard of the word “weeb”.

Explaining the meaning of the word “weeb” is actually a little tricky, since it comes from internet slang. It was originally a short form of “weeaboo” — a nonsense word invented on an old web forum, meaning a non-Japanese person who is obsessed with Japanese culture.

The dictionary definition of “weeb”

still claims that it’s a derogatory term for people who are overly obsessed with Japan. But this hasn’t been the case for a while. Like the word “otaku” in Japanese or “nerd” in English, “weeb” started out as an insult but eventually became a semi-ironic badge of honor. And like those other slang words, “weeb” has come to be applied in a much looser, more casual sense.

There are still the classic, hardcore weebs — the people who flock to

anime conventions

and enter cosplay competitions and study Japanese just so they can play the untranslated versions of every Final Fantasy game. These enthusiasts form

a vibrant and highly original subculture

that has spread throughout the world.

14

In another essay in this volume, I try to explain this subculture.

But like “otaku” and “nerd”, “weeb” is starting to take on a looser, more general meaning. Just as anyone these days might jokingly refer to themselves as an “hiking otaku” for enjoying hiking, or a “tea nerd” for knowing a lot about tea, people in the English-speaking world are starting to refer to themselves as “weebs” for liking Japan and Japanese products in general.

It is in that looser, more general sense that America — like an increasing number of other countries — has become a weeb nation. And it is in this more general sense that the worldwide weeb trend can help Japan reclaim its position as a global center of high-tech innovation.

Everyone wants to go to Japan, and they’re starting to realize they can

By now, everyone in Japan knows all about the tourism boom, but the numbers are still staggering. In 2007, 8.4 million tourists came to Japan. By 2019 that number had almost quadrupled, and is now rebounding sharply from the pandemic:

The Japanese government intentionally encouraged tourism

starting in the early 2000s

, but the boom since 2012 has far exceeded their targets. So many people are visiting Japan that it’s

straining local infrastructure

, causing overcrowding, and prompting the locals to ask when the flood will recede. So far there’s no sign that foreigners are getting bored with Japan; tourism numbers in 2024

look set to top the record

set in 2019, with increasing arrivals from the U.S. and Europe more than canceling out a drop in visitors from China. Personally speaking, almost everyone I know in San Francisco is either going to Japan these days, or wants to go. Some have started going multiple times a year.

Eventually, something will probably have to be done about overtourism. But the boom in foreign travel to Japan has accomplished several important things, all of which will be potentially useful in boosting investment into Japan.

First, it has familiarized much of the world with Japan — what was once a mysterious far-off land is now just one more place you can go and hang out when you get some vacation time. And instead of reducing Japan’s overseas cultural cachet through boredom and familiarity, the tourism boom seems to have only deepened foreigners’ love of Japanese food, art, and culture.

Second, tourism is forcing Japanese cities — especially Tokyo — to become more user-friendly to foreigners. Signs in English and other foreign languages have proliferated, shopkeepers and restauranteurs are all used to dealing with non-Japanese customers, and so on.

Third tourism is rapidly dispelling the

previously common stereotype

of Japan as a closed-off, xenophobic country. Foreigners can now see for themselves how open, free, friendly, and welcoming of a country Japan actually is. For most people, this revelation makes little difference in their lives. But for a few, it has prompted a second realization — that instead of just visiting, they could go live and work in Japan.

Mass immigration to Japan

remains dominated

by people from poorer Asian countries, especially Vietnam and the Philippines. But

a 2020 survey

by the global money transfer service Remitly found that Japan topped the rankings of countries that Americans and Canadians would like to move to. Anecdotes about Americans moving to Japan are

starting to proliferate

. The real estate news website Mansion Global

reports

that “[Japan’s] appeal is now leading to a slow-growing influx of American expats moving to the country in search of full-time residences or second homes abroad.” Personally, I’m always surprised by the number of people I meet in the San Francisco tech industry who talk about moving to Japan. A few have even done it.

Two extremely important examples of Westerners who made this move are the founders of Sakana AI. On

Lux Capital’s website

, they note that Llion Jones “fell in love with Japan after spending a holiday there and moved to Tokyo in 2020.” As for Jones’ cofounder David Ha, he has spent much of his career in Japan since graduating from college.

It’s not just Westerners either. A growing number of Taiwanese people

want to work in Japan

. It’s not clear whether a desire to live in Japan on the part of TSMC’s workers was a factor in that company’s decision to invest in Kumamoto, but it certainly couldn’t have hurt.

Which brings me to the final effect of the tourism boom: It’s helping Japanese people to finally realize just how much the world loves their country. Japan may not yet know the word “weeb”, but it’s becoming conscious of the phenomenon itself.

But knowing

that

the world loves Japan is far easier than understanding

why

this is the case. In fact, there are no simple or easy answers to this question. I can venture my best guess as to the reasons for Japan’s unique global appeal, but it means I’ll have to venture beyond the realm of data and research and into the realm of supposition and amateur sociological theorizing.

It starts, I think, with Japan’s unique approach to urbanism.

Why people love Japanese cities

One strategy that

Japan has tried

in order to curb overtourism is to get tourists to visit small towns and rural areas instead of Tokyo and Kyoto. This strategy has failed, because Japan’s big cities are exactly what foreigners come to the country to see. To be sure, Japan’s rivers and mountains are beautiful, its small towns are quaint, and its temples and shrines are majestic. But what really makes Japan different from every other country in the world are its big cities.

Unless they have lived abroad, Japanese people have little idea what life in an American city is like. Unless you live in the center of New York City, life is typically lived in a point-to-point fashion. You move back and forth between your house, your office, and “third spaces” like stores, restaurants, bars, clubs, and parks. Usually you take a car, but perhaps sometimes a bicycle. If you’re poor you take a bus. The entire space between these points might as well be empty to you — you see signs and buildings as you drive by, but you’re usually focused on reaching your destination. A city thus becomes a network of points, rather than a space to be occupied.

This type of life can be comfortable, but it leaves little room for serendipity. Accidental meetings between friends and acquaintances are rare, unless there’s a cafe or bar that both people frequent. Accidental discovery of interesting new restaurants and shops are even rarer — instead, people use websites, word of mouth, and advertisements. And of course, accidental meetings with strangers are rare (which can be good or bad, depending on how extroverted you are).

Walkability and density are two reasons why Americans who move to Japan tend to feel like they’ve stepped into another universe. The ability to go anywhere without the stress of driving or the task of finding parking allows them a sort of freedom that few of them have ever known — Japanese people might consider an eight-minute walk to a train station to be

unacceptably long

, but to an American, that might as well be next door. And on the way to their destination, they’ll see far more people and far more interesting places to eat and shop. Where back home their commutes focused only on the destination, now the journey is half the fun.

Of course, Japanese cities are far from the only dense, walkable cities in the world. They also stand out for being extremely clean, quiet, and safe, and having some of the world’s most punctual and convenient trains. And Japanese urban infrastructure is always in excellent condition, due to timely and effective maintenance. But even these advantages aren’t quite unique — Zurich, Singapore, Stockholm, and Seoul all share those advantages. Japan’s cities have something extra special in addition.

I believe that that something is

commercial density

. Tokyo has an order of magnitude

more restaurants

than New York or Paris, and the disparity in retail stores is probably similar. Small business is

the lifeblood of Japanese cities

— and, in many ways, of the Japanese middle class. This might be partly cultural, but at least some of it is the result of deliberate policy. Japanese

zoning

usually limits the size of stores in mixed-use areas, ensuring that small businesses dominate. The

Large-Scale Retail Store Location Law

also provides some protection. And Japan’s government provides lots of support for people who want to start small businesses, including a variety of

subsidies

. This support, along with a culture of craftsmanship, might be why Japan’s independent restaurants and stores tend to stand out in terms of both quality and originality.

Commercial density is especially astronomical in central downtown neighborhoods like Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Ginza. Here Japan takes advantage of another secret weapon:

verticality

. In most cities — New York City, London, Paris, and even other Asian megacities like Hong Kong — most shops and restaurants are at ground level, with apartments and offices on the higher floors. But Japan has a special innovation: zakkyo buildings, with restaurants and stores mixed in with offices for several floors.

15

These buildings have two special features: 1) signs all the way up the side of the building, and 2) direct street access via elevators and stairs.

Zakkyo buildings do two special things for Japanese cities. They allow a huge amount of retail to be concentrated in a very small space, in hyper-dense eating and shopping districts like Shinjuku. And they allow people walking past the buildings to see and access those shops and restaurants very easily from the street. This makes walking through a Japanese downtown an even more magical, serendipitous experience than walking through a city like New York — there are just so many more places to explore. And it also allows more residential areas very close to the city center to be surprisingly quiet and livable, since so much foot traffic is drawn to the ultra-dense downtowns.

16

Of course, Zakkyo buildings also give Japanese cities their characteristic aesthetic. Columns of colorful electric signs running up the sides of buildings might seem tacky or antiquated to some Japanese people, but to foreigners, they create a distinctive beauty — a forest of lights that feels at once both enticing and soothing. Japan’s electric cityscapes feel more like luminescent trees or clouds than like something artificial — utterly different from the garish lights of Las Vegas or the overwhelming harshness of Times Square. This may be one of those features of Japan that it takes a foreign perspective to appreciate.

17

Essentially, Japanese cities represent

adventure

— every day you walk out of your door in Tokyo or Fukuoka or Nagoya, you know you’re likely to discover an amazing new place to eat, a cool new boutique, or a fun new bar. And in those beautiful settings, you’re likely to meet interesting new people — new friends, business partners, or even lovers.

18

Yet that adventure is a

safe and comfortable

one — urban Japan offers few dangers, or even inconveniences.

There are not many cities in the world that offer that winning combination. Traditionally, this is the role that Paris has played in the global imagination. But as I explain in another essay in this volume, Tokyo — and other Japanese cities — may be taking its place.

But although Japan’s unique urbanism is a big part of why foreigners are drawn to the country, it can only be part of the explanation — especially because many of the people who love Japanese products, and Japanese pop culture, have never even visited the country. There must also be cultural factors at work.

Japan as alternative modernity

For me to try to articulate which specific features of Japanese culture make it so uniquely appealing to foreigners is probably a lost cause. For one thing, culture is too complex to describe in language — the descriptions almost always end up being both boring and ambiguous, and usually fall back on tired stereotypes. It’s also likely that different aspects of a nation’s culture appeal to different groups of people.

19

And since neither government, business, or private citizens has deliberate control over a nation’s culture, the exercise would be useless.

Instead, I think it’s more useful to realize what Japanese culture represents to foreigners, in a more general sense. And what I think it represents is

alternative modernity

.

Politically and economically speaking, Japan is part of the West. It’s a democratic, capitalist, developed country, with a notion of human rights similar to what prevails in the U.S. or Europe. It trades extensively with the U.S. and the EU, and it has strong scientific and intellectual links with both. It is neither a repressive one-party state like China or Russia, nor a theocracy like Iran, nor an aristocracy like UAE.

And yet in a million small ways, Japan is culturally distinct from the U.S. or Europe — or from anywhere else. It has different mannerisms, different social customs, and different aesthetic sensibilities. People relate to their coworkers and their friends and their families in different ways. Japanese institutions — companies, schools, bureaucracies — all do things a bit differently than their peers elsewhere. Even tiny aspects of Japanese culture, like preferences for brand goods, or the way people read the manual when they buy a new camera, feel different in ways that are difficult to describe but easy to recognize.

This high density of tiny differences manifests in almost everything Japan produces. To a Japanese person, the word “anime” refers to any cartoon, but to the rest of the world, it represents a specifically Japanese style that’s instantly recognizable and

completely unique

. Japan’s global in art, design, architecture, and fashion stem partly from a culture of craftsmanship, but partly from the fact that Japanese people simply tend to create slightly different kinds of designs.

In other words, Japan is a place that is

substantively similar

to other rich, democratic, and free countries, but

feels different

. To people all over the world, it represents an alternative to the standard global version of modernity descended from West Europe. People who value the wealth and freedom of European-derived societies, but who feel oppressed or bored by European-derived cultures, find refuge and novelty in Japan and its products.

There is thus no single reason that the world has gone weeb. Instead, there are a myriad of small reasons. For those who want to boost FDI into Japan, I would say that understanding and cataloguing all of these reasons is much harder than simply taking advantage of their existence.

Part IV: Weebs to the rescue

Weeb entrepreneurs

So far, I’ve been a bit vague about how foreigners’ love of Japan can translate into more and better FDI. In fact, I think there are three basic channels by which this happens: entrepreneurs, workers, and finance.

First, consider entrepreneurship. Many analyses of Japan’s technological stagnation point out how Japanese people are less likely than Americans to start their own businesses. And yet the U.S. has a secret weapon here: immigrants.

Azoulay et al. (2022)

found that immigrants are almost twice as likely to start businesses as native-born Americans.

A 2018 study

by the National Foundation for American Policy found that among the top companies, the dominance of immigrant founders was even greater:

The research finds that 55%, or 50 of 91, of the country’s $1 billion startup companies had at least one immigrant founder…Nearly one-quarter (21 of 91) of the billion-dollar startup companies had a founder who first came to America as an international student…75 of the 91 companies, or 82%, had at least one immigrant helping the company grow and innovate by filling a key management or product development position.

And children of immigrants also tend to be highly entrepreneurial; almost half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children. In fact, just going down a list of America’s biggest companies reveals the outsized influence of immigration — Steve Jobs of Apple was the child of a Syrian immigrant, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang was born in Taiwan, Sergey Brin of Google came from the old Soviet Union as a child, Elon Musk of Tesla and SpaceX moved from South Africa, and so on. It’s not just the U.S., either — a similar dynamic is at play

in the UK

.

Why are immigrants so entrepreneurial? Selection obviously plays a role here — the kind of people who are willing to pick up and move to another country

tend to be self-starters

and risk-takers. Immigrants also tend to have higher skill levels, and some arrive with significant financial resources.

In addition, immigrants have

less of an outside option

than the native-born — it’s harder for an immigrant to get a safe, high-paying job at a large, established company, so it makes more sense to start a business. This effect has been evident in Japan’s past as well — ethnic Koreans started a number of big businesses in Japan, such as Softbank, Lotte, ABC-Mart, and GungHo.

20

Why do so many entrepreneurs move to America? Although hard data is difficult to come by, the American Dream must surely figure prominently in their calculations. The U.S. has the reputation of a place that welcomes entrepreneurial newcomers, and where anyone can strike it rich if they work hard and take risks.

Japan is unlikely to gain a similar reputation anytime soon, but that’s OK. It simply needs its own unique dream for would-be entrepreneurs — a story they can tell themselves about what their successful future will look like if they move. The dream has to involve financial success, of course — that’s why funding and growth opportunities, as well as the overall business ecosystem, are so important.

But just as the American dream includes the proverbial

big suburban house with a white picket fence

, the Japanese dream can leverage lifestyle elements as well. Immigrant entrepreneurs of the younger generation can dream of an adventurous, exciting life in the world’s nicest cities, and of immersing themselves in a culture that they’ve admired since childhood. In other words, Japan can offer entrepreneurs the Weeb Dream.

So the first way that the global weeb trend can help Japan is by swelling the ranks of its entrepreneurial class. Of course, Silicon Valley isn’t going to just pick up and move to Shibuya wholesale, any more than it’s going to move to London or Bangalore. But even a few hotshot entrepreneurs trying to make it in Tokyo can have a big outsized effect. They can attract follow-on investment and create buzz, like Sakana AI is doing. They can transfer key technologies from top U.S. research labs. They can inspire their Japanese entrepreneur

counterparts

with positive energy and new ideas for business models and fundraising strategies, and put them in touch with foreign capital. And they can tap export markets that Japanese entrepreneurs might not have thought to enter.

And over time, the trickle might become a flood. A few weeb entrepreneurs today could help their friends follow in their footsteps, as well as inspiring whole generations of global weebs to consider Japan. This is essentially what happened with the Japanese tourism boom, which took over a decade to get off the ground, and which built slowly via word of mouth.

Weeb capital

High-growth companies need more than bold and brilliant founders. They also need lots and lots of financing — not just in the early stage, but later on, as they attempt to scale up. For years, observers have noted that Japan is especially weak at late-stage startup funding. A

recent Nikkei analysis

calls this the “second death valley”:

Young Japanese companies are struggling to continuously expand their revenues compared with their peers in the U.S. and Europe, partially owing to their significant lack of access to capital needed for growth, a Nikkei analysis shows…

[S]tartups in Japan face the ""second death valley"" as their growth comes to a halt for failure in post-listing fundraising…Behind the phenomenon is the shortage of investors who can take the risk of providing funds to unlisted companies, forcing Japanese startups to seek going public at an early stage.

Foreign funding can help. VCs, private equity firms, and even banks in the U.S. and other startup-friendly countries are more used to dishing out large amounts of money for late-stage startups. If they can be interested in Japan, they can not only supplement Japan’s domestic financiers, but also teach them how to manage the risks of large late-stage investments.

In fact, now may be the perfect moment. Venture capital used to be an extremely localized industry, where in-person meetings were essential to getting funded. But in recent years, especially since the pandemic, VCs have become more comfortable establishing branch offices and looking for opportunities outside of Silicon Valley and other traditional U.S. tech hubs. The San Francisco Bay Area’s share of VC deals

fell below 20% in 2023

. And they’re starting to diversify overseas, too. In the 2010s, much of this went to China, but that trend is

in full reverse

in the era of decoupling. Meanwhile, VC investment into India and the rest of Asia is

still going strong

.

And more global VCs are taking an interest in Japan, as

Nikkei Asia reports

:

Overseas venture capital funds are stepping up investment in Japanese startups, spending nearly 70% more on the year in the January-June period as geopolitical tensions make China a less attractive target…VC investment by overseas players totaled 22.5 billion yen ($152 million) in the first half, up 69%…The figure accounts for roughly 20% of total VC funding in Japan, including those by domestic investors…The increase by foreign players far outpaces the 4% rise for the total.

Bain Capital Ventures, an important late-stage VC firm, is

looking to double

its investments in the country. Vinod Khosla, one of the investors in Sakana AI,

has predicted

that Japan will become an AI hub. Nor is American capital the only player here — venture firms from

Taiwan

and

South Korea

are planning major expansions in Japan.

What draws capital to Japan? The country’s still-substantial domestic market is one factor, of course, as is its history of technological leadership. Japan’s government is also helping, often co-investing with foreign funds. But here is an interesting paragraph I noticed in

Lux Capital’s announcement

of its investment in Sakana AI:

We see Japan becoming a pivotal hub in a new global axis of AI, drawing exceptional regional and international talent to companies that are leaders in the most competitive fields. With world-class infrastructure, an enviable quality of life, and a high-skilled local workforce, we expect Sakana AI will be the vanguard of a wave of excellent AI startups. [Lux Capital partner] Grace [Isford] lived for part of her childhood in Japan as an expat, and we look forward to many more people taking advantage of Japan’s increasingly open immigration for top technical talent.

Here is a case of a venture capitalist with a personal connection to Japan making a bet on the country’s potential. As with entrepreneurs themselves, financiers can be drawn to Japan by their personal affinity for the country.

Investing in Japan, after all, gives VCs a reason to visit frequently, or even relocate. And where VCs themselves go, their dollars follow. The Weeb Dream can thus help Japan become a destination for the capital that its startup ecosystem currently struggles to find at home.

Weeb talent

For over a decade, Japan’s government has been

trying to attract high-skilled immigrants

to the country, as its own talent pool shrinks due to low birth rates. In 2012 it created a points system for skilled immigrants, and in 2017 it

significantly reduced

the requirements for permanent residency for those skilled workers. But during the 2010s it

struggled

to attract those workers in large numbers.

Why? Language is obviously a barrier, but this is true for a lot of other countries as well. An issue more unique to Japan is the traditional lifetime employment system is another barrier — young workers often have low salaries, since they expect to get steady raises over the course of their careers.

In contrast, a talented young employee in the U.S. can get paid several times the median income — an entry-level software engineer at Google

gets paid around $204,000

(¥29,000,000) on average as of this writing, which is about five times as high as the median personal income in the U.S. An entry-level hardware engineer at Nvidia

gets paid around $153,000

(¥21,750,000). Those are positions for new graduates, right out of college.

No matter how much young people would love to live in Japan, it’s difficult for Japanese companies using the traditional lifetime employment system to compete with those salaries, even taking the lower cost of living into account. A foreign worker is unlikely to take advantage of Japan’s traditional lifetime employment system, which means that attracting skilled foreigners requires paying workers higher salaries earlier in their careers.

21

FDI can help. Japanese branches of foreign-owned companies will generally not use the lifetime employment system, and will therefore be able to offer higher salaries to young workers from overseas. For example, an entry-level software engineer at Google in Tokyo gets paid around $115,000 (¥16,350,000). That’s pretty competitive, considering Japan’s cheaper cost of living.

And when you add the Weeb Dream to the equation, it’s actually possible for Japan to compete for global talent. When I asked the team at Spellbrush why they opened a branch office in Tokyo, they told me that the only way they could hire the world’s best AI researchers without paying them sky-high salaries was to offer them a chance to work in Japan.

How Japan can get more weebs

Finally, we get to the key question: How can Japan actually leverage its international appeal — the Weeb Dream — to get more FDI, more exports, and more global talent? What more can the government and businesses do that they’re not already doing?

Here are just a few ideas.

Idea 1: A big push

Simply recognizing the fact that there is huge unsatisfied global demand for life in Japan is the key first step. It implies that the amount of resources that the government and businesses are currently applying toward attracting FDI and top talent could be increased substantially, and that this increase would pay off.

The model for a big FDI push should be the the tourism promotion effort that

started in 2006

with the Tourism Nation Promotion Basic Law. This took almost a decade to start seeing significant results, so patience and consistency are important here. Once the trend is established, it’s likely to exceed expectations.

Japanese government agencies who want to promote FDI — JETRO, METI as a whole, the Cabinet Office, and various prefectural governments — should both step up and diversify their own efforts, exploring new ways to market Japan to the world. They should also actively partner with the private sector — Japanese VCs, with Japanese businesses that would like to form joint ventures, and with upstream Japanese industries that stand to benefit from FDI (like the semiconductor tool industry). Each of these types of businesses can find their own marketing channels, and they can offer standardized investment or joint venture packages for foreign investors — similarly to how Japanese airlines offer cheap tickets and standardized tour packages.

Japan should also enlist foreigners who have already invested in Japan. Ideas spread by word of mouth, and once a few prominent foreigners start giving their testimonials about how investing and living in Japan, many others will start to consider the idea. An example is software entrepreneur Patrick McKenzie, whose

writings about life and business in Japan

inspired others in the U.S. to think seriously about Japan as a destination.

22

Right now, efforts to pitch Japan as an FDI destination

tend to emphasize

its business climate, human resources, and safety. Adding

depictions of life in Japan

to this basic pitch would help harness the power of the Weeb Dream. The best way to do this is probably to promote images and videos of foreigners working and living in Japan — as Americans say, a picture is worth a thousand words.

23

Idea 2: A “Japan Life Pass” and a “Japan Investment Pass”

Tourism to Japan has been helped a great deal by the existence of various standardized package deals. These deals give foreigners a push-button solution for traveling to Japan, alleviating the need to plan flights, hotels, and sightseeing tours separately. And the Japan Rail Pass, introduced in 1981, has given tourists a push-button solution for getting around the country. The Japan Rail Pass is famous outside of Japan; its very existence serves as an advertisement for tourism to the country.

A similarly famous, standardized solution for moving to Japan could do something similar for FDI and foreign talent. For life in Japan has gotten a lot easier thanks to technology — especially Google Translate, Google Maps, and ChatGPT. But there are still some important things that can be difficult. These include:

Finding a place to live

Getting a phone plan

Opening a bank account

Ward registration

Tax preparation

The Japanese government can create a Japan Life Pass that helps with all of these things. The government could partner with private companies — real estate agents, phone companies, banks, tax prep services, and so on — to help foreigners with each of these processes as soon as they arrive.

Obviously a Japan Life Pass would not be made available to any and all foreigners. Instead, it would require some qualifications. For example, anyone whose company has made a major investment in greenfield FDI in Japan, or any investor with a definite plan to make a major greenfield FDI investment, should should be able to get the pass.

The Japan Life Pass should also offer special Japanese language classes, exclusively for holders of the pass. This will be helpful for improving the language skills of foreign entrepreneurs, investors and workers, but it will also be extremely useful for networking. The classes can also include local Japanese investors and entrepreneurs as guest speakers, facilitating further networking and business relationships.

There should also be a parallel Japan Investment Pass for foreign-invested startups and Japanese subsidiaries. This pass would provide package-deal access to various legal and accounting services that small, fast-growing businesses need — incorporation, worker visas, tax preparation, accounting, and various business development services like local recruiting. There are already private companies like

Venture Japan

that provide these packages; the government should simply give their services an official imprimatur.

24

In fact, Shibuya ward in Tokyo does something like this, with its “

Shibuya Startup Deck

”.

The purpose of these “passes” isn’t just to make life easier for foreigners who want to invest in Japan. They will also serve as

marketing

. The name “Japan Life Pass” is catchy, easy to remember, and self-explanatory, and it’s similar to the well-known Japan Rail Pass. Simply hearing the name will immediately tell every potential foreign investor that the Japanese government intends to make it easy for foreigners to move to and invest in Japan.

Idea 3: Make bank accounts easy

When I ask foreigners who set up businesses in Japan about their most severe “pain points”, I always get the same answer:

banking

. Using Japan’s retail and commercial banking services was never particularly easy or simple for foreigners, but with the recent implementation of anti-money-laundering provisions, it has become

even more onerous

.

An investor, executive, or engineer who moves to the United States can typically set up a bank account within a single day; in Japan, getting a standard savings account now takes six months. In addition, Japanese banking requires a personal seal, which cannot be obtained before establishing residence in the country. This means that moving to Japan, investing there, and doing business there takes a long time and a lot of effort. It’s a significant barrier to FDI.

If the U.S. can effectively fight money laundering without these onerous requirements, Japan can too. Bank accounts should be quick to get, and it should be possible to get a personal seal from outside Japan. The Financial Services Agency and the Ministry of Finance should come up with a concrete action plan for making banking a rapid, push-button process for foreign investors and for the employees of companies who invest in Japan.

Idea 4: Weeb neighborhoods

Some immigrants like to immerse themselves in local culture, forcing themselves to sink or swim. Others like to move to an immigrant “enclave” city or neighborhood where they can be around other immigrants for some of the time. These enclaves facilitate networking, and can also serve as advertisements for life in a country — for example, Irvine, California became

a popular destination

for Asian immigrants.

25

In fact, Japan is already starting to build enclaves like this. In Kumamoto, there are major efforts to

build infrastructure

for TSMC’s Taiwanese employees — not just trains and housing, but also an international school, a “Taiwan Town” filled with ethnic retail businesses, and so on. In Tokyo, Shibuya ward has gone out of its way to provide

support for foreigners’ startups

, with the aforementioned Shibuya Startup Deck, entrepreneurship classes, networking, and even a special visa for entrepreneurs. Even some small Japanese towns, like Tanegashima, are trying to

become destinations

for digital nomads.

Japan’s government can encourage the creation of these enclaves in at least two ways. First, the national government can partner with specific local governments to implement entrepreneurship support like Shibuya’s and capacity building like Kumamoto’s.

Second, the government can work with developers and real estate agencies, schools, and day care centers that serve foreigners, arranging for them to cluster in specific areas. Having a family with children can be especially challenging in a foreign country, and neighborhoods that feel very livable for high-earning immigrant families with kids can be magnets for talent.

26

An example of such a neighborhood is Tamachi in Tokyo.

Sustaining the Weeb Dream

The ideas I laid out in the previous section are all designed to help foreign entrepreneurs, investors, and workers turn the Weeb Dream into reality. They all take the existence of that dream for granted. In fact, so far, Japan has not had to do anything in order to create and sustain the global weeb phenomenon; like the American Dream, it has been a completely organic, bottom-up phenomenon.

There is the danger that at some point, Japan will lose its distinctiveness and its international appeal. This is not an immediate danger, but the government should think about ways to preserve the aspects of Japan that make it special, so that the Weeb Dream never dies.

One way is to continue supporting small, independent retail businesses. The vast diversity of highly original shops and restaurants is what makes Japanese cities special, but sustaining that diversity might be difficult in an age of low fertility rates. Already, many independent boutiques in Tokyo’s famous fashion districts of Harajuku and Omotesando are being replaced by boring international chains like Gucci and Zara.

Meanwhile, as the authors of

Emergent Tokyo

document, big developers in Tokyo and other cities have recently favored indoor malls without the exterior signs and easy street access that make zakkyo buildings and yokocho so distinctive. People go to Japan to visit places like Omoide Yokocho, Yasukuni-dori, and Golden Gai, not places like Shibuya Hikarie, Tokyu Kabukicho Tower, or Azabudai Hills.

Japan’s government shouldn’t ban big malls, of course, but it should increase its support for the types of local businesses and shopping areas that have made it so distinctive. This means planning new yokocho-type areas like Ebisu Yokocho, and new zakkyo buildings, shotengai, and so on. It means continuing and even stepping up its support for independent retail businesses — including shops and restaurants started by foreigners.

Another threat to the Weeb Dream, ironically, is overtourism. Visiting Japan is a magical experience for many, but at a certain point it becomes so crowded with visitors that the magic is lost. My suggestion for balancing these imperatives is to have big cities like Tokyo and Kyoto enact a special surcharge on hotel and Airbnb reservations made to people outside the country. Visitors all need somewhere to stay, so this is just an easy, unobtrusive way of enacting a congestion tax for tourism. The surcharge will allow city governments to adjust tourism levels to their desired amounts, redirecting tourist dollars to rural areas and smaller cities while also reaping more tax revenue for the Tokyo and Kyoto city governments.

The Weeb Dream also relies on the continuing international appeal of Japan’s pop culture. Japan’s past efforts to promote its culture at the government level, especially the Cool Japan initiative, have

been underwhelming

. Instead, the key is to

encourage independent Japanese auteurs

in the manga, anime, film, TV, music, art, and fashion. It was

the genius of independent creators

like Miyazaki Hayao, Tezuka Osamu, and Anno Hideaki that made manga and anime so vibrant and unique.

If the era of those titans gives way to boring cookie-cutter corporate slop — as has unfortunately happened in Hollywood — it will erode Japan’s distinctiveness and appeal in the long term. Thus, Japan should encourage independent creators in every artistic field, including cheap or free studios, exhibition spaces, and so on. And IP law and regulatory policy should ensure that artists in all fields get a significant cut of the financial profit from their creations, including merchandising deals.

The Weeb Dream wasn’t inherited from the time of the samurai; it was created in the modern day, by the independent efforts of millions of highly creative independent Japanese businesspeople and artists. Maintaining that dream doesn’t require fancy overseas marketing efforts; it merely requires giving Japan’s creative people the space to work and thrive.

Semipermeable membranes: A theory of Japan

Some readers may find this essay to be self-contradictory. Even as I extolled the benefits of Japan’s uniqueness and distinctiveness, I advocated bringing in foreign businesses to boost its economy. How can these two things be reconciled?

In fact, I believe that this duality has always been Japan’s unique strength. Japan has always thrived from being a land of

semipermeable membranes

. Just as a cell’s membrane allows in some ions and molecules but keeps others out, Japan has always been at its best when it sampled selectively from the outside world.

During Tokugawa era, Japan’s isolation caused it to stagnate and fall behind the West. Its rapid catch-up in the Meiji Period involved importing vast amounts of

foreign knowledge

and taking ideas from many foreign institutions. Yet at the same time, Japan’s government and its businesses constantly tried to adapt these ideas and institutions to Japan’s existing culture instead of simply aping them.

Japan’s postwar economic miracle was similar. Research results and inventions from the U.S. and Europe inspired Japan’s own scientists and innovators, who then combined these ideas with their own, and added Japanese business models and design sensibilities, to make world-beating high-tech companies. Japan’s legendary manufacturing techniques were inspired partly by the work of Edward Deming and Peter Drucker, but added plenty of local innovations as well.

The art and cultural output that has made the world love Japan also springs from a combination of foreign and domestic ideas. The plots of Japanese sci-fi comics, games, and cartoons sample liberally from foreign works,

27

but mix them into something distinctive and unique. Japan’s legendary street fashion took some inspiration

from the U.S.

, Britain, and various European countries, ultimately surpassing all of these in creativity.

In other words, Japan’s greatness has always relied on taking

some

things from the outside world, but not

too much

. FDI will do the same. It won’t replace or overwhelm Japan’s domestic businesses; instead, it will provide them with just enough new ingredients to maintain their vitality.

I believe that this was the deliberate plan of the Meiji reformers who built modern Japan. Instead of self-defeating isolation or surrender to foreign invaders, they chose a third way — a country that mixes foreign ideas and technologies with local culture in appropriate measured amounts. The success of their strategy is more than apparent a century and a half later, in the world’s love for the distinctiveness and originality of the nation they created.

Now Japan is once again is stagnant and in need of fresh ideas. But it has an asset it didn’t have a hundred and fifty years ago — a world of weebs who stand ready to help.

believes

that the crisis hurt Japan by causing the yen to appreciate. His theory is that it forced Japanese exporters to cut prices in order to maintain short-term market share, but that this deprived them of the earnings they needed to keep investing in research and development — ultimately leading to a loss of their technical edge to Chinese and Korean competitors.

In fact, monetary policy was far more important than fiscal policy under Abe. Concerns about government debt meant that it

wasn’t really possible

to deploy significant fiscal stimulus. In fact, what little “stimulus” did get employed under Abe was often in the form of

bailouts for inefficient, failing companies

, which might have reduced productivity growth by a modest amount. There are also arguments that monetary easing reduced productivity growth by allowing Japanese companies to borrow money too cheaply and avoid restructuring. While I think this is

theoretically possible

, I highly doubt that this was a big part of the productivity story in Japan; by the 2010s, Japanese companies in general had

deleveraged

, and therefore didn’t need to borrow cheaply in order to survive.

Actually, in Chapter 4 of

The Contest for Japan’s Economic Future

, Katz inadvertently ends up providing a bit of evidence in favor of Schaede’s argument. He shows that Japan’s global market share for niche manufactured products in 2018 was only 3% of total global manufacturing sales volume — about equivalent to China, only a little higher than Europe, and less than the United States. However, Japan’s population is less than a tenth of China, a third of Europe, or half of the United States. So Katz’ data supports Schaede’s conclusion that Japan punches above its weight in terms of niche manufacturing. At the same time, though, Katz’s data does show that niche manufacturing is too small to support an economy on its own. This reinforces the conclusion that multi-strategy development is needed.

This comparison may not be entirely fair. TSMC’s plant in Arizona is more advanced than either of the ones being built so far in Japan, meaning construction is trickier and more complex. And the delay at TSMC Arizona ended up being

much smaller

than initially feared, after a successful deal with U.S. unions and some construction assistance from Taiwan. Still, the smoothness of the construction in Kumamoto, whose timeliness was never in doubt, is impressive.

The typical categorization here is a little different than the one I’m using. Typically, FDI is classified as “horizontal”, “vertical”, or “conglomerate”. This breakdown is more useful when thinking about corporate strategy, while I think my breakdown is more useful for thinking about a nation’s development strategy.

7

This is similar to the “overcapacity” strategy that

China has used in the 2020s

, except that in addition to cheap bank loans, China also encourages production with huge government subsidies on top of cheap bank loans. MITI, in contrast, would try to tamp down over-competition and overproduction between Japanese companies when they deemed it excessive.

To be precise, increased demand for a country’s exports leads to an improvement in a country’s terms of trade, leading to an appreciation of the real exchange rate.

, promoting Japan as a destination for FDI, was gorgeous and well-articulated. Better cooperation between government agencies on projects like this would be a good idea. Japanese government agencies should hire some American web designers for their own websites. I can recommend some good ones, if anyone is interested.

11

In fact, it’s possible that one additional reason for Japan’s loss of international competitiveness after 2007 was that for national security reasons, Japanese companies invested less heavily in China than companies from South Korea, Taiwan, and Europe in the late 2000s and 2010s.

A group of architecture weebs, including Jorge Almazan and Joe McReynolds, wrote an excellent book about Tokyo’s dense commercial spaces, entitled

Emergent Tokyo: Designing the Spontaneous City

16

The ultimate example of this is probably Shibuya’s Shōtō, a neighborhood that feels isolated and suburban even though it’s just a few minutes’ walk from one of the most densely trafficked pedestrian areas on the planet.

17

In fact, I have a large photo of the zakkyo buildings on Shinjuku’s Yasukuni-dori hanging on the wall of my apartment. At some point I plan to replace it with one or more of my own photos, but I was in a hurry to decorate, and you can’t really go wrong with Yasukuni-dori.

One can argue that the boom in global interest in urban Japan began with the 2003 movie

Lost in Translation

, which depicts a romantic relationship between two Americans visiting Tokyo. Although relatively little of Japanese culture is depicted in the film, the visual backdrop of Tokyo lends an air of romance to the story that would be hard to capture elsewhere.

19

For example, unlike the hardcore weebs, I was never a very big anime fan — and certainly not a fan of the shonen and shojo anime that dominates weeb culture. Instead, I was always drawn to Japan’s underground scenes — street fashion, amateur art, independent film, and underground music.

20

Zainichi entrepreneurship in Japan has

fallen in recent decades

, as employment discrimination has diminished. The intergenerational assimilation of immigrant groups is why new immigration waves are so important for entrepreneurship.

21

Naturally, these salaries increase less over the course of a worker’s career than in Japan’s traditional lifetime employment system. Thus, some companies that use the traditional lifetime employment system can still remain competitive, since Japanese workers may choose to get paid more when they’re older. But for foreign workers who are unlikely to stay at a single company for decades, paying more up front is the only way.

22

In fact, McKenzie’s depiction of business in Japan is often filled with criticism and frustration towards Japan’s traditional lifetime employment system. Yet despite this criticism, his writings got a lot of American tech people to consider living in Japan, when they never would have even considered it before. This demonstrates that brand ambassadors for Japan need not always be “pro-Japan” in their writing style — it’s enough that they simply put the idea of moving to Japan into people’s minds.

23

An even more ambitious idea is to produce a reality TV show about foreign entrepreneurs in Japan. Americans love shows like Terrace House and Old Enough!, and streamers who talk about life in Japan are also quite popular. A Netflix series, or even a series of YouTube videos, depicting the life that awaits foreign workers and entrepreneurs in Japan could potentially be a big hit.

24

It’s important for the government to partner with a variety of different companies, instead of just one in each area. This will ensure competition, which will raise the quality of these services. Using only a single private-sector partner or provider will tend to result in low quality.

25

Immigrant enclaves can sometimes isolate immigrants and

limit their opportunities

. But thanks to Japan’s dense urbanism, enclaves in large cities like Tokyo are unlikely to isolate high-skilled immigrants from the populace at large.

26

In the U.S., these are typically called “bedroom communities”. A classic example is Fremont, California, home to many engineers and researchers who work around Silicon Valley. Its high schools are among the highest-achieving schools in the entire U.S.

A lot of readers tell me that my fundamental optimism about the world is one of the reasons they appreciate my blog. I think my usual sunny attitude springs from my above-average skill at resisting

the negativity bias

inherent in the media. It’s very easy to read the news every day and conclude that the world is in a never-ending hydra-headed “

polycrisis

”; if you have a cool, detached perspective, you’ll realize that things are rarely so dark.

That said, this year I was a bit of a downer. The coming of the second Trump administration means the end of

the era of stability

that the world enjoyed after World War 2. Even if the U.S. can fix its domestic problems (which are not all Trump’s fault by a long stretch), the ascendance of China and Russia as the world’s dominant power bloc will not be so easily undone, and the ramifications of that shift are only getting started. That’s what motivated the somewhat darker tone of my blog this year.

But that doesn’t mean I think the world is going to Hell in a handbasket. From

India’s resilient economic growth

to Europe’s timely rearmament to the ongoing technological revolutions in

AI

,

electric technology

, and biotech, there is plenty to be happy about.

Even when it comes to American society, I see lots of quiet reasons for optimism. Our politics is dysfunctional and our media landscape resembles a demon-haunted wasteland, but underneath the surface, I see signs that our society is starting to knit itself back together after the unrest and chaos of 2014-2021. Health is improving. Violence is falling. Americans are starting to use technology more responsibly. Some of the economic sclerosis of the pre-pandemic years seems to be falling away.

I suspect that there are “

macrosociological

” forces at work. To my knowledge, sociologists haven’t really modeled a cycle of aggregate social division and health,

1

but if you look at events like the collapse of the USSR and the decade of violence and self-destructive behavior that followed in Russia, or

the multi-decade rise in pro-social behavior

around the mid-20th century in America, it’s hard to avoid the suspicion that such forces exist.

But I’ll leave the grand theorizing for another day. Today I just want to document ten positive trends in American society. It’s been a tough year; you all deserve a little optimism!

Life expectancy is up

This is probably the most encouraging recent social trend in America. One of the biggest downsides of life in the U.S., compared to other rich countries, is our low life expectancy. A big gap opened up a few decades ago, and in recent years, and in the late 2010s, Americans’ life expectancy fell outright for several years. Then came the pandemic, of course, and it fell right off a cliff.

But I’m happy to report that this trend has now reversed! Not only has U.S. life expectancy more than bounced back from the pandemic, but the negative trend of the 2010s seems to be over as well. The gap with other rich countries remains, but the U.S. is no longer falling further and further behind:

Why is U.S. life expectancy improving? There are

two main reasons

why Americans live shorter lives than their rich-world counterparts: Unsafe behavior, and obesity. The first of these — overdoses, suicides, murders, and traffic accidents — surged after the pandemic but is now on the wane.

Murder is down (and violence is down in general)

The most important way in which life in America differs from life in other rich countries is our high level of violence. Murder rates — the most reliable measurement of violence — are typically around 5 or 6 per 100,000 people in America. That’s about five times as high as in Europe and ten or twenty times as high as in East Asia. And it’s a proxy for a bunch of other kinds of public violence — assaults, robberies, etc. — that are harder to compare across countries or across time.

I believe that America’s high violence levels are

the main reason

our cities are so car-dependent — many people refuse to take public transit or walk on shop-lined streets if they’re in danger of getting mugged or attacked. That means that some part of our obesity and boredom is also downstream of violence.

In the late 2010s, U.S. murder rates went in the wrong direction, rising from their low point in 2014. Then in the pandemic they spiked alarmingly. But in late 2021 or 2022, murder rates started falling, and they haven’t stopped falling since. There are several data sets that record murder rates, based on reporting by hospitals, police agencies, and so on. But they all closely agree. Here are two sources:

Jeff Asher, who does a great job documenting trends in American violence, notes that many other indicators of violence in America are down as well, including reports of gun crime and reports of violent crime other than homicides:

2025 Year in Review: A Remarkable Drop In Crime

The number of crimes reported to law enforcement agencies almost certainly fell at a historic clip in 2025 led by the largest one-year drop in murder ever recorded — the third straight year setting a new record — and sizable drops in reported violent and property crime. This assessment will not be confirmed until the FBI releases formal estimates for 20…

Most encouragingly, the drop appears to have continued, or even accelerated, in 2025. Murders are plunging in almost every big city:

Trump’s return has not led to the reestablishment of the negative trend of the mid-2010s. Just why this has happened deserves a longer blog post, but for right now we should just celebrate the new trend.

Asher’s best guess is that although overall violence in America remains above its historic low point in the early 1960s, murder and property crime are now

less common

than they were during that famously peaceful era. Part of that is due to mitigation efforts — everyone moved out to the ‘burbs and started locking their houses and driving everywhere. America remains far too violent to support the kind of pleasant urban life that Europeans and East Asians enjoy. But for many years we were going the wrong way, and now we’re headed in the right direction.

I hope everyone had a Merry Christmas! Winter holiday season is here, and for

an increasing number

of Americans, that means traveling abroad. Europe and Mexico are still hot destinations, but in recent years, Japan has skyrocketed to the top. In many places, Tokyo is the most-booked international flight destination:

Some of this is because of transfer flights to the rest of Asia, but most of it is just because practically everyone in America — and the world — at large

wants to go to Japan these days

. Every year, various friends text me requests for my Japan recommendations right around this time of year (I should really write a blog post summarizing these. I did one in the 2010s, but it’s totally out of date.) I myself will be there in early January.

Anyway, the fact that everyone is going to Japan right now provides a perfect opportunity for me to explain how the world’s love for Japan creates a key opportunity for that island nation to revive its sluggish economy.

In March, I published my first book,

Weeb Economy

— but only in Japanese. Half of the book was

a series of translated posts

from my blog, so those are already in English. The other half was a new part that I wrote in English and had translated into Japanese by my excellent translator, Kataoka Hirohito. Eventually the whole book will come out in English, but right now I’m publishing the new half as a series of blog posts. Here are the first two:

Part I: “

I Want the Japanese Future Back!

”. Here I explained why Japan is now basically a developing country again, and why this requires bold, persistent experimentation with new economic approaches.

Part II: “

FDI is the Missing Piece of Japan’s Puzzle

”. In this post I cited some prominent examples of how foreign-owned factories, research centers, and startups are already giving Japan’s cutting-edge high-tech industries a boost. I explained why one specific type of foreign direct investment —

greenfield platform investment

— is so much more important than the other types, and why Japan largely ignored this type of investment until recently. I explained the many benefits of greenfield platform investment, and listed some ways that Japan’s current economic conditions make it especially favorable to this type of investment.

In this third installment, I explain one of Japan’s most important advantages in attracting greenfield investment: the fact that

everyone loves Japan and lots of people want to live there

. I present data showing just how popular Japan is right now, and I try to give some explanations as to why people around the world love the Land of the Rising Sun so much.

The world loves everything Japanese, but Japan doesn’t realize it

In 2015, my employers at Bloomberg Opinion sent me to Japan to learn about the state of the Japanese economy. They helped me arrange many interesting discussions. I talked to the Financial Services Agency about the new corporate governance code; to Goldman Sachs about women joining the workforce; to Foreign Ministry officials about trade treaties; to an economics professor about fiscal sustainability; and so on. But the interview that stuck in my mind for many years after was with a manager at Kodansha.

My goal for the meeting was to learn about Japan’s efforts to increase its cultural exports — something the Western press had been talking about

for decades

. So I was absolutely astonished when the Kodansha manager told me that his company had no strategy and no plans to increase their sales of manga and anime in overseas markets. Even more surprising was his explanation as to why. “Americans don’t want to see Asian faces,” he told me.

I stared at him in slack-jawed amazement. Nothing could be further from the truth, I told him. I didn’t have international statistics on hand, but I knew that Asian media was taking the U.S. by storm. Manga sections were steadily

growing in American bookstores

. K-pop was

exploding in popularity

. Cosplay conventions had become mainstream. Overseas anime sales were starting their long upward climb:

Association of Japanese Animations

In 2015, these trends were already becoming apparent, but they’ve only accelerated. From the TV show

Shogun

sweeping the 2024 Emmy Awards, to the Korean film

Parasite

winning the Oscars in 2020, to Oscars for the Japanese movies

Godzilla Minus One

and

The Boy and the Heron

, to Korea’s BTS becoming

the biggest band in the world

, there has been no shortage of proof that “Asian faces” — or, more precisely, the products of Japanese and Korean imaginations — are

exactly

what the world wants to see.

But these examples can’t fully convey how Japanese pop culture, in particular, has become a memetic shorthand that young generations in America and many other countries use to communicate, to define themselves, and to understand the world.

When I moved to a new apartment last year, the movers stopped to talk to me about anime. When I went to hang out with some venture capitalists at their lavish San Francisco apartment, they asked me if I wanted to watch some anime. When I tutored children in math as a college student back in the 2000s, it was hard to get the kids to pay attention, because they were drawing anime characters in their notebooks. Anime tropes like “Notice me, senpai!” have crept into the American lexicon. When I go to my friends’ startup offices, there are manga volumes on the shelves. When I argue with strangers online, their avatars are faces from anime.

These aren’t just anecdotes.

A survey

of Americans by the website Polygon in early 2024 found that 42% of Gen Z watches anime every week, compared to just 25% who watch the NFL. Younger survey respondents reported that anime influences many basic aspects of their life — style, identity, friendship, and even attraction. (That’s just in the U.S., but as far as I know, this trend is worldwide — anime viewership is

growing even faster

in Europe, Brazil, and the Anglosphere.)

In fact, the increasing Japanese influence on American life goes far beyond pop culture. Over the past two decades, Japanese food has increasingly become the most sought-after cuisine. New Yorkers

line up around the block

to get into ramen restaurants that would be considered average in Japan. Wagyu has become a

national obsession

. Omakase has become

a pinnacle of find dining

, and words like

kaiseki

and

izakaya

are becoming part of the standard lexicon. Matcha has become a delicacy — expensive shops

advertise

“the finest matcha tea from the shade-grown farms of Kyoto, Japan”. Even non-Japanese restaurants

sometimes affect

Japanese names and pseudo-Japanese decor in order to seem higher class — allowing to charge a hefty price premium. It’s hard to find a high-end cafe or restaurant in San Francisco these days that doesn’t have something yuzu-flavored.

Nor is it just food. In the high-end home furnishing stores where rich Americans shop, Japanese-made ceramics and other objects command a hefty price premium. At the more affordable end, Daiso, Uniqlo, and Muji have become all the rage. Japanese artists like Kusama Yayoi have become such staples of high culture that the trend has been

parodied in Netflix dramas

. Fashionistas in trendy cafes will have

B-side Label

stickers on their laptops and bags.

As with food, even the veneer of Japanese fashion and design is enough to impart a sense of high class and good taste. Seeing boutiques with katakana on their signs on St. Mark’s Place in New York City, or Haight Street in San Francisco, is now commonplace, even if the goods inside aren’t from Japan. Trendy American brands will give themselves Japanese-inspired names like “

Baggu

”. I often joke that the U.S. is in the middle of a great shift — in the 19th and 20th centuries, high class in America was defined as “anything French”, while in the 21st century it’s defined as “anything Japanese”.

Japan’s international cachet can be seen in a variety of international surveys and rankings. In 2023, Japan topped the

Anholt-Ipsos Nation Brands Index

, which has measured international perceptions of various developed countries for 15 years:

Japan also regularly comes in

at or near the top

of a similar international survey by the BBC. Recently,

Japan was ranked #2

on U.S. News and World Report’s list of the “best countries in the world”, which combines various subjective metrics to assess a country’s international appeal. And another survey by Conde Nast

put Japan in the top spot

.

In my experience, most Japanese people are generally unaware of any of this. Earth became a weeb planet in spite of

the failure

of the Japanese government’s attempts to promote Japanese culture overseas. It has been an organic, disorganized, bottom-up phenomenon — Japanese culture simply holds a special appeal to the people of the U.S. and much of the rest of the world.

The most important word about Japan that Japanese people don’t know

In fact, even more astonishing than my interview with Kodansha is the fact that to this day, I have not met a single Japanese person who has heard of the word “weeb”.

Explaining the meaning of the word “weeb” is actually a little tricky, since it comes from internet slang. It was originally a short form of “weeaboo” — a nonsense word invented on an old web forum, meaning a non-Japanese person who is obsessed with Japanese culture.

The dictionary definition of “weeb”

still claims that it’s a derogatory term for people who are overly obsessed with Japan. But this hasn’t been the case for a while. Like the word “otaku” in Japanese or “nerd” in English, “weeb” started out as an insult but eventually became a semi-ironic badge of honor. And like those other slang words, “weeb” has come to be applied in a much looser, more casual sense.

There are still the classic, hardcore weebs — the people who flock to

anime conventions

and enter cosplay competitions and study Japanese just so they can play the untranslated versions of every Final Fantasy game. These enthusiasts form

a vibrant and highly original subculture

that has spread throughout the world. In another essay in this volume, I try to explain this subculture.

But like “otaku” and “nerd”, “weeb” is starting to take on a looser, more general meaning. Just as anyone these days might jokingly refer to themselves as an “hiking otaku” for enjoying hiking, or a “tea nerd” for knowing a lot about tea, people in the English-speaking world are starting to refer to themselves as “weebs” for liking Japan and Japanese products in general.

It is in that looser, more general sense that America — like an increasing number of other countries — has become a weeb nation. And it is in this more general sense that the worldwide weeb trend can help Japan reclaim its position as a global center of high-tech innovation.

Everyone wants to go to Japan, and they’re starting to realize they can

By now, everyone in Japan knows all about the tourism boom, but the numbers are still staggering. In 2007, 8.4 million tourists came to Japan. By 2019 that number had almost quadrupled, and is now rebounding sharply from the pandemic:

The Japanese government intentionally encouraged tourism

starting in the early 2000s

, but the boom since 2012 has far exceeded their targets. So many people are visiting Japan that it’s

straining local infrastructure

, causing overcrowding, and prompting the locals to ask when the flood will recede. So far there’s no sign that foreigners are getting bored with Japan; tourism numbers in 2024

look set to top the record

set in 2019, with increasing arrivals from the U.S. and Europe more than canceling out a drop in visitors from China. Personally speaking, almost everyone I know in San Francisco is either going to Japan these days, or wants to go. Some have started going multiple times a year.

Eventually, something will probably have to be done about overtourism. But the boom in foreign travel to Japan has accomplished several important things, all of which will be potentially useful in boosting investment into Japan.

First, it has familiarized much of the world with Japan — what was once a mysterious far-off land is now just one more place you can go and hang out when you get some vacation time. And instead of reducing Japan’s overseas cultural cachet through boredom and familiarity, the tourism boom seems to have only deepened foreigners’ love of Japanese food, art, and culture.

Second, tourism is forcing Japanese cities — especially Tokyo — to become more user-friendly to foreigners. Signs in English and other foreign languages have proliferated, shopkeepers and restauranteurs are all used to dealing with non-Japanese customers, and so on.

Third tourism is rapidly dispelling the

previously common stereotype

of Japan as a closed-off, xenophobic country. Foreigners can now see for themselves how open, free, friendly, and welcoming of a country Japan actually is. For most people, this revelation makes little difference in their lives. But for a few, it has prompted a second realization — that instead of just visiting, they could go live and work in Japan.

Mass immigration to Japan

remains dominated

by people from poorer Asian countries, especially Vietnam and the Philippines. But

a 2020 survey

by the global money transfer service Remitly found that Japan topped the rankings of countries that Americans and Canadians would like to move to. Anecdotes about Americans moving to Japan are

starting to proliferate

. The real estate news website Mansion Global

reports

that “[Japan’s] appeal is now leading to a slow-growing influx of American expats moving to the country in search of full-time residences or second homes abroad.” Personally, I’m always surprised by the number of people I meet in the San Francisco tech industry who talk about moving to Japan. A few have even done it.

Two extremely important examples of Westerners who made this move are the founders of Sakana AI. On

Lux Capital’s website

, they note that Llion Jones “fell in love with Japan after spending a holiday there and moved to Tokyo in 2020.” As for Jones’ cofounder David Ha, he has spent much of his career in Japan since graduating from college.

It’s not just Westerners either. A growing number of Taiwanese people

want to work in Japan

. It’s not clear whether a desire to live in Japan on the part of TSMC’s workers was a factor in that company’s decision to invest in Kumamoto, but it certainly couldn’t have hurt.

Which brings me to the final effect of the tourism boom: It’s helping Japanese people to finally realize just how much the world loves their country. Japan may not yet know the word “weeb”, but it’s becoming conscious of the phenomenon itself.

But knowing

that

the world loves Japan is far easier than understanding

why

this is the case. In fact, there are no simple or easy answers to this question. I can venture my best guess as to the reasons for Japan’s unique global appeal, but it means I’ll have to venture beyond the realm of data and research and into the realm of supposition and amateur sociological theorizing.

It starts, I think, with Japan’s unique approach to urbanism.

Why people love Japanese cities

One strategy that

Japan has tried

in order to curb overtourism is to get tourists to visit small towns and rural areas instead of Tokyo and Kyoto. This strategy has failed, because Japan’s big cities are exactly what foreigners come to the country to see. To be sure, Japan’s rivers and mountains are beautiful, its small towns are quaint, and its temples and shrines are majestic. But what really makes Japan different from every other country in the world are its big cities.

Unless they have lived abroad, Japanese people have little idea what life in an American city is like. Unless you live in the center of New York City, life is typically lived in a point-to-point fashion. You move back and forth between your house, your office, and “third spaces” like stores, restaurants, bars, clubs, and parks. Usually you take a car, but perhaps sometimes a bicycle. If you’re poor you take a bus. The entire space between these points might as well be empty to you — you see signs and buildings as you drive by, but you’re usually focused on reaching your destination. A city thus becomes a network of points, rather than a space to be occupied.

This type of life can be comfortable, but it leaves little room for serendipity. Accidental meetings between friends and acquaintances are rare, unless there’s a cafe or bar that both people frequent. Accidental discovery of interesting new restaurants and shops are even rarer — instead, people use websites, word of mouth, and advertisements. And of course, accidental meetings with strangers are rare (which can be good or bad, depending on how extroverted you are).

Walkability and density are two reasons why Americans who move to Japan tend to feel like they’ve stepped into another universe. The ability to go anywhere without the stress of driving or the task of finding parking allows them a sort of freedom that few of them have ever known — Japanese people might consider an eight-minute walk to a train station to be

unacceptably long

, but to an American, that might as well be next door. And on the way to their destination, they’ll see far more people and far more interesting places to eat and shop. Where back home their commutes focused only on the destination, now the journey is half the fun.

Of course, Japanese cities are far from the only dense, walkable cities in the world. They also stand out for being extremely clean, quiet, and safe, and having some of the world’s most punctual and convenient trains. And Japanese urban infrastructure is always in excellent condition, due to timely and effective maintenance. But even these advantages aren’t quite unique — Zurich, Singapore, Stockholm, and Seoul all share those advantages. Japan’s cities have something extra special in addition.

I believe that that something is

commercial density

. Tokyo has an order of magnitude

more restaurants

than New York or Paris, and the disparity in retail stores is probably similar. Small business is

the lifeblood of Japanese cities

— and, in many ways, of the Japanese middle class. This might be partly cultural, but at least some of it is the result of deliberate policy. Japanese

zoning

usually limits the size of stores in mixed-use areas, ensuring that small businesses dominate. The

Large-Scale Retail Store Location Law

also provides some protection. And Japan’s government provides lots of support for people who want to start small businesses, including a variety of

subsidies

. This support, along with a culture of craftsmanship, might be why Japan’s independent restaurants and stores tend to stand out in terms of both quality and originality.

Commercial density is especially astronomical in central downtown neighborhoods like Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Ginza. Here Japan takes advantage of another secret weapon:

verticality

. In most cities — New York City, London, Paris, and even other Asian megacities like Hong Kong — most shops and restaurants are at ground level, with apartments and offices on the higher floors. But Japan has a special innovation: zakkyo buildings, with restaurants and stores mixed in with offices for several floors. These buildings have two special features: 1) signs all the way up the side of the building, and 2) direct street access via elevators and stairs.

Zakkyo buildings do two special things for Japanese cities. They allow a huge amount of retail to be concentrated in a very small space, in hyper-dense eating and shopping districts like Shinjuku. And they allow people walking past the buildings to see and access those shops and restaurants very easily from the street. This makes walking through a Japanese downtown an even more magical, serendipitous experience than walking through a city like New York — there are just so many more places to explore. And it also allows more residential areas very close to the city center to be surprisingly quiet and livable, since so much foot traffic is drawn to the ultra-dense downtowns.

Of course, Zakkyo buildings also give Japanese cities their characteristic aesthetic. Columns of colorful electric signs running up the sides of buildings might seem tacky or antiquated to some Japanese people, but to foreigners, they create a distinctive beauty — a forest of lights that feels at once both enticing and soothing. Japan’s electric cityscapes feel more like luminescent trees or clouds than like something artificial — utterly different from the garish lights of Las Vegas or the overwhelming harshness of Times Square. This may be one of those features of Japan that it takes a foreign perspective to appreciate.

Essentially, Japanese cities represent

adventure

— every day you walk out of your door in Tokyo or Fukuoka or Nagoya, you know you’re likely to discover an amazing new place to eat, a cool new boutique, or a fun new bar. And in those beautiful settings, you’re likely to meet interesting new people — new friends, business partners, or even lovers. Yet that adventure is a

safe and comfortable

one — urban Japan offers few dangers, or even inconveniences.

There are not many cities in the world that offer that winning combination. Traditionally, this is the role that Paris has played in the global imagination. But as I explain in another essay in this volume, Tokyo — and other Japanese cities — may be taking its place.

But although Japan’s unique urbanism is a big part of why foreigners are drawn to the country, it can only be part of the explanation — especially because many of the people who love Japanese products, and Japanese pop culture, have never even visited the country. There must also be cultural factors at work.

Japan as alternative modernity

For me to try to articulate which specific features of Japanese culture make it so uniquely appealing to foreigners is probably a lost cause. For one thing, culture is too complex to describe in language — the descriptions almost always end up being both boring and ambiguous, and usually fall back on tired stereotypes. It’s also likely that different aspects of a nation’s culture appeal to different groups of people. And since neither government, business, or private citizens has deliberate control over a nation’s culture, the exercise would be useless.

Instead, I think it’s more useful to realize what Japanese culture represents to foreigners, in a more general sense. And what I think it represents is

alternative modernity

.

Politically and economically speaking, Japan is part of the West. It’s a democratic, capitalist, developed country, with a notion of human rights similar to what prevails in the U.S. or Europe. It trades extensively with the U.S. and the EU, and it has strong scientific and intellectual links with both. It is neither a repressive one-party state like China or Russia, nor a theocracy like Iran, nor an aristocracy like UAE.

And yet in a million small ways, Japan is culturally distinct from the U.S. or Europe — or from anywhere else. It has different mannerisms, different social customs, and different aesthetic sensibilities. People relate to their coworkers and their friends and their families in different ways. Japanese institutions — companies, schools, bureaucracies — all do things a bit differently than their peers elsewhere. Even tiny aspects of Japanese culture, like preferences for brand goods, or the way people read the manual when they buy a new camera, feel different in ways that are difficult to describe but easy to recognize.

This high density of tiny differences manifests in almost everything Japan produces. To a Japanese person, the word “anime” refers to any cartoon, but to the rest of the world, it represents a specifically Japanese style that’s instantly recognizable and

completely unique

. Japan’s global in art, design, architecture, and fashion stem partly from a culture of craftsmanship, but partly from the fact that Japanese people simply tend to create slightly different kinds of designs.

In other words, Japan is a place that is

substantively similar

to other rich, democratic, and free countries, but

feels different

. To people all over the world, it represents an alternative to the standard global version of modernity descended from West Europe. People who value the wealth and freedom of European-derived societies, but who feel oppressed or bored by European-derived cultures, find refuge and novelty in Japan and its products.

There is thus no single reason that the world has gone weeb. Instead, there are a myriad of small reasons. For those who want to boost FDI into Japan, I would say that understanding and cataloguing all of these reasons is much harder than simply taking advantage of their existence.

Europe has

a lot on its plate these days

. It’s facing a hostile Russia that has no intention of stopping with Ukraine. It’s dealing with tariffs and various other threats from an unpredictable and hostile Trump administration. And it’s struggling with internal unrest over migration from the Middle East and Central Asia. That would be enough to keep anyone occupied. But on top of all that, Europe is being buffeted by the Second China Shock.

The Second China Shock is another name for the flood of high-tech exports that China has been sending out around the world in the last few years.

China’s economy is still suffering

from the prolonged effects of the real estate bust that began in late 2021. In response, Xi Jinping’s government has unleashed

the most expensive

and wide-ranging industrial policy the world has ever seen, promoting high-tech manufacturing across a variety of sectors. Because the economy is in the doldrums, Chinese consumers themselves

aren’t able to buy all the stuff

that their government is paying Chinese companies to make — electric vehicles, ships, machinery, and so on. So the companies are selling that stuff overseas, anywhere they can, for cut-rate prices.

In Europe, that has manifested as

a giant trade deficit

with China:

Bloomberg

This flood of Chinese exports to Europe is being boosted by several tailwinds. First, China’s currency has gotten cheaper — partly as a result of China’s weak domestic economy, and partly because the government has pushed down the exchange rate in order to pump up exports. Shanghai Macro Strategist

writes

:

This combination — falling relative prices in China and a weaker currency — has made Chinese goods and services extraordinarily cheap in global terms…A vivid example: a night at the Four Seasons Beijing costs roughly $250, compared with more than $1,160 in New York. The price gap is so extreme that it no longer reflects relative productivity or income levels; it reflects a currency that has become fundamentally undervalued…At these valuations, it is virtually impossible for most countries to compete with Chinese exporters. The current level of the yuan is simply too cheap to support a sustainable rebalancing of global trade.

Here’s a chart showing the yuan’s recent depreciation against the euro:

The second tailwind is Trump’s tariffs. Although Trump has backed off of most of his threats of tariffs on China, some important changes — like the end of the “de minimis” exemption for small packages — have gone into effect. And the threat of tariffs is probably prompting Chinese companies to seek other markets. As a result, Chinese exports to America are falling fast, while the country’s exports to other regions — Europe, Southeast Asia, and Latin America —

are booming

:

Rhodium Group

Some people claim that China’s surge of exports to these other countries is actually going indirectly to the U.S. Those people are wrong. As

Gerard DiPippo has shown

, “transshipment” to America is quite low. China simply found new customers to buy its products. Europe is the most important of those customers.

This means that although Trump’s boneheaded tariffs on allied countries have hurt U.S. manufacturing, his tariffs on China — and his threats of even higher tariffs on China — have partially insulated America from the Second China Shock. Europe as yet has no such insulation.

At this point you may ask: Who cares? China is selling a bounty of useful consumer goods to Europeans at cut-rate prices; why look that gift horse in the mouth? If a store in your neighborhood had a blowout sale, you’d enjoy it, wouldn’t you? And on top of all that, many of China’s fastest-growing exports to the EU — electric cars and such — are “green” technology that Europe has been trying to promote in order to fight climate change.

Given that Europe has so much else to worry about, why shouldn’t it just take the cheap Chinese stuff, enjoy the high-quality cars and the lower carbon emissions, accept deindustrialization, and focus on services instead? That’s basically what

The Economist recommended

in an article last month:

Indeed, the best hope of consolation for Europe lies not in stopping the China shock, but in weathering it. Manufacturing looms large in politics, but accounts for only 16% of the EU’s GDP, a far lower proportion than services (70%). Even in Germany its share is only 20%. The industries in which China is making inroads—cars, machinery, metals, pharmaceuticals and chemicals—account for more than 10% of the value of industrial activity in only a few European countries, notably the Czech Republic, Germany and Hungary…De-industrialisation, in other words, need not be synonymous with decay.

But as pleasant and easy as this might sound, it would actually be very foolish, for a number of reasons.

First, there’s the military angle. Health care and education and entertainment are nice things to have, but to fight a modern war you need drones, missiles, satellites, ships, planes, and vehicles of all kinds. And with Russia breathing down Europe’s throat, and America no longer a reliable ally, there is a good chance that Europe will soon have to fight a modern war against a high-tech opponent. Russia’s population is smaller than Europe’s, but its economy is now heavily oriented toward military manufacturing. Russian production is also now

supported by China

, whose companies are selling Russia weapons and even allegedly

building weapons in Russia

.

In order to resist that threat, Europe will need lots of manufacturing. That doesn’t just mean having European governments purchase ammunition and tanks from defense contractors. It means scaling up Europe’s civilian manufacturing of vehicles, electronics, chemicals, and so on, so that if Russia

does

start a wider war, Europe can repurpose those civilian industries for large-scale military production. If Europe allows itself to be deindustrialized, its military capabilities will be limited to whatever the government can purchase in peacetime.

The second problem is that Europe’s trade with China is increasingly unbalanced. Europe is not trading services for the flood of electric cars, solar panels, and so on that China is sending. Instead, Europe is writing IOUs. That’s what a trade deficit is — the writing of IOUs in exchange for imports. Robin Harding of the Financial Times recently warned about this unbalanced trade, in an eloquent article entitled “

China is making trade impossible

”:

There is nothing that China wants to import, nothing it does not believe it can make better and cheaper, nothing for which it wants to rely on foreigners a single day longer than it has to. For now, to be sure, China is still a customer for semiconductors, software, commercial aircraft and the most sophisticated kinds of production machinery. But it is a customer like a resident doctor is a student. China is developing all of these goods. Soon it will make them, and export them, itself…

[I]f China does not want to buy anything from us in trade, then how can we trade with China?…[W]ithout exports, we will eventually run out of ways to pay China for our imports.

A trade deficit is not a gift; it is a loan. That loan must be paid back. The Europeans who take out the loan may be insufficiently long-term in their thinking, effectively borrowing against their own futures to consume in the present. It’s up to government to look out for the prosperity of future generations.

On top of all that, some people think that at extremes of unbalanced trade in high-tech industries, the conventional wisdom that trade is mutually beneficial might break down. Goldman Sachs recently released a report claiming that Chinese exports will actually make Europe

poorer

Greg Ip offers his thoughts in

a thread

:

Fascinating and important report from Goldman Sachs. They have upgraded long-term GDP of China because of increased exports, but see this as reducing, not increasing, rest of world GDP. Chinese displacement of domestic manufacturing swamps any positives from cheaper goods…

This confirms what I have long suspected: Chinese growth does not “contribute” to global growth except in the purely arithmetic sense. It does not actually create positive feedbacks that lift other countries’ growth. That’s by design...The  point of Xi's ""dual circulation"" is to make the world more dependent on the Chinese industrial supply chain, while making China self-sufficient, that is buying less from the rest of the world. The model is inherently ""beggar thy neighbor"" (as Goldman notes)[.]

How would this work? Usually, when we think of “beggar-thy-neighbor” trade policies, it’s in the context of recessions; if aggregate demand is scarce, then trade deficits can make it worse. But while China is in a demand-driven growth slowdown right now, Europe is not. So there’s not really a

macroeconomic

reason to think that Chinese imports are making Europeans poorer.

Instead there must be a

microeconomic

reason. Obviously, even unbalanced trade is voluntary — Europeans

want

to write IOUs for Chinese goods — and we generally think that any voluntary trade must benefit both sides, or else they wouldn’t have done it in the first place. Thus, if Chinese imports actually make Europe poorer, it must be through an externality — some kind of negative spillover effect that the Europeans who buy BYD’s cars don’t take into account when they make their purchase.

In

a New York Times op-ed

back in July, the economists David Autor and Gordon Hanson — who famously coined the term “China Shock” in

their research with David Dorn

about the effect of Chinese imports back in the 2000s — seem to argue that such an externality exists:

China Shock 2.0…is where China…is aggressively contesting the innovative sectors where the United States has long been the unquestioned leader: aviation, A.I., telecommunications, microprocessors, robotics, nuclear and fusion power, quantum computing, biotech and pharma, solar, batteries. Owning these sectors yields dividends:

economic spoils from high profits and high-wage jobs

; geopolitical heft from shaping the technological frontier; and military prowess from controlling the battlefield. [emphasis mine]

What might that negative externality be? One possibility is that it’s what economists call a “pecuniary externality” — not a true destruction of value, but an appropriation of economic “rents” from one country to another. Paul Krugman’s

New Trade Theory

shows how because manufacturing is subject to increasing returns, trade barriers can sometimes reappropriate “rents” to your own country, by allowing your companies to gain scale. In other words, right now, BYD can produce things cheaply because its customer base is really big. If European countries raise trade barriers against BYD cars, their own car companies could gain more scale and become more efficient — and more competitive — by capturing the domestic market, thus transferring some of BYD’s profits to European automakers.

Another possibility is that preserving manufacturing increases a country’s

innovative capacity

. Manufacturing results in “learning by doing” — a kind of research that can’t be done in a lab, but which creates real knowledge and real productivity gains. There may also be a positive externality from having a ton of engineers in a country — what Brad DeLong calls a “

community of engineering practice

” — because these engineers get together and swap and combine their ideas. This is probably one reason why

industrial clusters

like Silicon Valley are so unusually productive.

If electric cars are made in China and shipped to Europe, all the innovation will be done in China. A lot of that innovation will be in the form of a bunch of little tricks that can’t easily diffuse to other corporations and other nations; in other words, the benefits will stay in China and make profit for BYD. But if Europe manufactured EVs for itself, most of the engineers who learned those tricks would generate knowledge for Europe.

Benigno et al. (2025)

call this the “global financial resource curse”. The authors argue that corporate innovative activity requires corporate profits; if all the profit is being made in China, that will naturally starve Europe of a lot of innovation.

No European consumer who buys a BYD car is thinking about economies of scale or innovative capacity; they just want a car. But the decisions of all of those car-buyers could add up to a loss of scale and innovation for European companies that left all of Europe a bit poorer as a result.

So if Europe fails to fight the Second China Shock — if it embraces the comfortable euthanasia of deindustrialization — it will be militarily weaker in the face of the Russian threat, its international financial position will deteriorate, and it may be economically poorer as a result.

Those are good reasons for Europe to fight the Second China Shock. But how? Unfortunately, as Robin Harding argues, protectionism is going to have to be part of the solution:

The difficult solution [to the Second China Shock] is [for Europe] to become more competitive and find new sources of value…That means more reform, less welfare and less regulation…Even that, however, will not be enough in a world where China offers everything cheaply for export and has no appetite for imports itself…Which leads to the bad solution: protectionism. It is now increasingly hard to see how Europe, in particular, can avoid large-scale protection if it is to retain any industry at all.

This path is so damaging and so fraught it is hard to recommend it…It would mark a further breakdown of the global trade system…Yet when the good options are gone, the bad are all that is left. China is making trade impossible. If it will buy nothing from others but commodities and consumer goods, they must prepare to do the same.

Protectionism

, be it with tariffs or non-tariff barriers, is essential in order to

de-risk

the reindustrialization of Europe. If a German or French company knows that at any moment, China’s massive industrial policy apparatus could swoop into their industry and put them out of business, they’ll be too shy to invest. Trade barriers are important because manufacturing investment is far less daunting behind that sheltering wall.

EU tariffs and other trade restrictions should

only be on China

— not on any other country (unless it’s doing large-scale transshipment of Chinese-made goods). In fact, Europe can lower trade barriers with more friendly countries in order for these countries’ manufacturing industries to attain large scale. Rush Doshi calls this “

allied scale

”.

The EU should also pair protection with

export subsidies

for European manufacturers. Foreign markets are just as important as the European market, and it would be a disaster to lose those. Europe can never match the scale, speed, and tolerance for waste of China’s industrial policy. But sometimes international buyers would rather hedge their bets and buy from Europe instead of onboarding themselves into the Chinese political-economic system. Just the other day, Vietnam decided to partner with Germany’s Siemens to

build its high-speed rail

, instead of with a Chinese company.

Another idea is to take a page from China’s book, and encourage Chinese companies to set up joint ventures with European companies in order to sell their products into the European market — or even force Chinese companies to do this, with

“buy European” rules

. If BYD has its car factories in Poland or Hungary, Europeans will be learning how to make electric cars well. Some of that knowledge will eventually diffuse to domestic European companies as well. And if Europe has to fight a total war against Russia, it can just nationalize those factories and use them for military applications.

Finally, Europe should think about taking action on China’s undervalued currency. This is the approach recommended by Brad Setser and Mark Sobel,

who argue

that pressuring China to allow the yuan to appreciate significantly would defuse a lot of trade tensions. China’s leaders think that Japan suffered economically after

a similar agreement in 1985

, but the threat of losing the European market might be even scarier.

This all sounds very grim, but on the bright side, EU action against the Second China Shock could be the beginning of a newer, more stable, more balanced, more equitable global economy. Tariffs on Chinese value added would force Chinese companies to move their factories abroad, to Vietnam or Indonesia or other poorer countries, which would help those countries industrialize. They would also accelerate China’s transition to a normal economy, by temporarily increasing

involution

and forcing China to curb overproduction. And an appreciation of the Chinese currency would make the global financial system more stable.

But in any case, Europe has little choice at this point. It can’t afford to become a deindustrialized, service-intensive backwater — especially not in the face of all the other threats it faces. The Second China Shock must be resisted.

According to

the Civil Rights Act of 1964

, it’s illegal to discriminate against anyone based on race or sex. That includes discrimination against White men. If your company or your nonprofit or your university or your government agency tries to avoid choosing White men for a job position, you have violated American civil rights law. Every year, including under Democratic administrations, the U.S. government brings cases against employers for discriminating against non-Hispanic White people, and it often wins these cases (

Example 1

,

Example 2

,

Example 3

).

But having a law against racial discrimination doesn’t automatically get rid of it. Those cases are hard to win, they take a lot of time and money to prosecute, and a lot of plaintiffs probably don’t even know they can sue. It’s not clear how many Americans even understand that the Civil Rights Act protects White men in the first place.

As an analogy, the U.S. government has been prosecuting anti-Black discrimination pretty vigorously for decades, but at least as of 2015, some still existed. A meta-analysis of field experiments by Quillian et al. (2017) found that employers in the early 2010s were still around 50% more willing to contact a White-seeming applicant for a job than a Black-seeming one:

Source:

Quillian et al. (2017)

(As a side note, the authors did find that discrimination against seemingly

Hispanic

candidates had fallen since the 1970s, and may have vanished entirely by 2015.)

So the law is not all-powerful. If a bunch of organizations in American society decide to discriminate based on race, the government has limited ability to stop them.

In a recent article titled “

The Lost Generation

”, Jacob Savage makes a convincing case that discrimination against White men rose significantly in America starting in the mid-2010s, and especially after 2020, especially in universities and the entertainment industry. Some excerpts:

The doors seemed to close everywhere and all at once. In 2011, the year I moved to Los Angeles, white men

were

48 percent of lower-level TV writers; by 2024, they

accounted

for just 11.9 percent…White men fell from 39 percent of tenure-track positions in the humanities at

Harvard

in 2014 to 18 percent in 2023…

In the aftermath of George Floyd’s death…

The New York Times

solemnly

promised

“sweeping” reforms—on top of the sweeping reforms it had

already

promised

.

The Washington Post

declared

it would become “the most diverse and inclusive newsroom in the country.” CNN

pledged

a “sustained commitment” to race coverage, while

Bon Appétit

confessed

that “our mastheads have been far too white for far too long”…

These weren’t empty slogans, either. In 2021, new

hires

at Condé Nast were just 25 percent male and 49 percent white; at the California Times, parent company of

The Los Angeles Times

and

The San Diego Union-Tribune

, they

were

just 39 percent male and 31 percent white. That year

ProPublica

hired 66 percent women and 58 percent people of color; at

NPR

, 78 percent of new hires were people of color.

“For a typical job we’d get a couple hundred applications, probably at least 80 from white guys,” the hiring editor recalled. “It was a given that we weren’t gonna hire the best person… It was jarring how we would talk about excluding white guys.” The pipeline hadn’t changed much—white men were still nearly half the applicants—but they were now filling closer to 10 percent of open positions…

White men may still be 55 percent of Harvard’s Arts & Sciences faculty (down from 63 percent a decade ago), but this is a legacy of Boomer and Gen-X employment patterns. For tenure-track positions—the pipeline for future faculty—white men have

gone

from 49 percent in 2014 to 27 percent in 2024 (in the humanities, they’ve gone from 39 percent to 21 percent)…At Berkeley, white men were 48.2 percent of faculty applicants in the Physical Sciences—but just 26 percent of

hires

for assistant professor positions. Since 2018, only 14.6 percent of tenure-track assistant professors hired at Yale have been white American men. In the humanities, that number was just six out of 76 (7.9 percent).

This is only a tiny portion of the article, which runs to 9000 words. These numbers are a smoking gun in terms of racial and gender discrimination, but Savage also documents plenty of examples where institutions were quite open and explicit about their desire to avoid hiring white men. He also talks to some White men who succeeded in the face of this discrimination, and finds that everyone knew the discrimination was in full force.

I am no lawyer, so don’t take my word for this, but much of what Savage describes seems grossly illegal. Until the Supreme Court’s recent ruling, diversity was an acceptable reason to have racial preferences in

university admissions

, but to my knowledge it was never an acceptable reason to discriminate in

hiring

. If anti-discrimination law were easy to enforce, most of these universities and media businesses would be getting slapped with enormous fines (just as many more businesses would have been slapped with fines for discriminating against Black, Hispanic, or Asian people over the years). But anti-discrimination law is very hard to enforce — partly because the burden of proof is so high, partly because people who sue for discrimination risk being personally stigmatized. And so most of the perpetrators are likely to escape scot-free.

Some people have argued that anti-White discrimination is not a big deal, because White men are still doing well

as a group

. Matt Bruenig has

a good post

showing that aggregate economic outcomes for White men haven’t really declined in recent years. For example, the percent of young White men who land in the top percentages of the earnings distribution has declined, but only by a small amount:

Source:

Matt Bruenig

And the percentage of White men who work in arts and media bounces around, but has stayed around 2.5%:

Source:

Matt Bruenig

Bruenig argues that to the extent that it seems that White men are vanishing from various occupations in America, this is due to the shrinking percent of White men in the American population.

Bruenig’s numbers help explain why the problem of discrimination against White men went unnoticed for so long. If you were in an industry or an institution that didn’t have much discrimination against White men, you could look around at wider society and still see White men succeeding at about the same rates as before. For example, I never personally encountered discrimination against White men in grad school — all the White guys I went to grad school with got good jobs, and all the people who ended up with the best jobs were White guys. Nor did I see anything at Stony Brook University or at Bloomberg.

There was thus nothing in my

personal

life to alert me to the increasing prevalence of discrimination against White men. And as Bruenig notes, the trend hadn’t yet shown up in aggregate statistics. So when I heard a few people start to complain on social media in the 2010s, I didn’t appreciate that anything had changed — especially because the people who complained tended to be the same right-wing types who were complaining about anti-White discrimination in the 2000s and the 1990s. The people who suffered personally from this discrimination — White men in progressive institutions and industries — were the ones who were most afraid to speak up about it.

Nor was I unusual in my slowness to realize that something had shifted.

As of 2019

, almost no White Americans thought that being White made it harder for them to get ahead, and only a third of Whites said they had ever experienced racial discrimination:

Source:

Pew

Source:

Pew

It thus wasn’t until 2020 or 2021, when a flood of credible reporting came out about the new discriminatory trend, and when my friends in the tech industry

started to talk openly about it

, that I realized that something big had changed.

But Bruenig’s analysis, while praiseworthy for its attention to hard data (unlike much of the discourse around this topic), is not a convincing argument against Savage’s thesis. First of all, the shifts Bruenig documents are small but not trivial — a decrease in the percentage of young White men who make it to the top 10% from 20% to 17% can’t be explained by the shrinking percent of White men in the population. And showing that about the same number of White men work in arts and media over the years doesn’t tell us much about the quality, salary, prestige, or advancement opportunities of the jobs in which they’re working.

The real reason that Bruenig’s analysis shouldn’t mollify us, however, is that we shouldn’t treat

aggregate group outcomes

as the end-all and be-all of economic fairness.

The capitalist system is remarkably effective at allowing people to succeed in the face of discrimination. Although anti-Black discrimination in audit experiments has remained more or less constant over time,

Fryer (2010)

shows that

in aggregate

, anti-Black discrimination explains less and less of the racial gap in outcomes over time — once you control for education levels, racial inequality in the job market went way down in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. And

Hsieh et al. (2019)

argue convincingly that improved allocation of talent across racial groups has contributed to rising U.S. GDP. Some percent of hiring managers may still be suspicious when they hear a Black-sounding name, but discrimination doesn’t keep Black Americans down nearly as much as it used to.

By the same token, discrimination against White men can be pretty common, especially within certain industries, without keeping White men down as a group. Imagine that instead of

quitting because of management changes and a run-in with the Chinese Communist Party

, I had been kicked out of Bloomberg for being a White man. I make a lot more money with this Substack than Bloomberg ever paid me. So aggregate income statistics would have actually shown a

gain

for White men as a group. But I still would have been rightfully resentful, because discrimination would have forced me to go out of my way and take more risks and take a more non-traditional path to success.

(Note: I love Bloomberg, and they never discriminated against me in any way. This example was only for the sake of argument.)

In the same way, lots of American White men may have responded to a wave of discrimination since 2014 by going around the traditional employment system — starting their own businesses, working in non-traditional industries like crypto, and so on. And ultimately, in terms of income, many of them may have turned out fine — so many that the aggregate racial statistics show only a modest change. But those people are still fully justified in being angry at the

unfairness

of racial discrimination. And even if only a small percentage of White men had their careers destroyed by the wave of discrimination since 2014, that’s still a serious injustice.

This is also why discrimination against White men in academia, the media, or other progressive-dominated spaces is not a remedy for discrimination against Black people and women that still exists in some corners of American society. If half of American industries discriminate against White people and the other half discriminate against Black people, things may balance out at the

aggregate group level

, but lots of both White and Black Americans will still experience the sting of unfairness from being personally denied jobs they deserve, and from being kept out of the industries they want to work in.

Anti-White and anti-Black discrimination are not like matter and antimatter; they don’t just cancel each other out. An America where every job has racial preferences, and you have to look around for the jobs that favor your race instead of relying on individual merit and trusting the system, would clearly be a

dystopia

.

Aggregate group outcomes are not enough to make the American system

feel fair

. If I have my heart set on being a professor but I can’t get an academic job because I’m a White man, the fact that the richest billionaires in America are mostly White men will provide me with exactly zero comfort. People don’t succeed as racial blocs; they succeed as individuals. And fairness has to be provided at

the individual level

. That’s why laws like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 quite rightly make no reference to aggregate group outcomes. A feeling of individual fairness is what makes our system function.

Notice I said “feeling”. In practice, the widespread perception of fairness is only imperfectly correlated with actual procedural fairness. It’s very hard to tell when you’ve personally been discriminated against, since you only have a sample size of 1. If you get turned down for a job, how do you know how good the other applicants were? If you get fired, how do you know it was because of your race and gender, rather than your job performance, or your cultural fit, or some personal conflict with a coworker? And so on. It’s a difficult signal extraction problem.

Discrimination can’t be eliminated. Instead, our goal should be to

preserve trust in the system’s individual fairness

. If people believe that the system is unfair, it will drive down trust in institutions and make it harder to provide public goods. One reason the second Trump administration is

attacking academic science much more

than the first Trump administration did is that Republicans’ trust in scientific institutions fell after 2020:

Source:

Pew

Some of that was related to Covid, of course, but some was

probably due to the increased racial and gender discrimination

that Jacob Savage’s article documents. It was not simply a function of right-wing media ginning up hysteria. It was real.

If we want to preserve or rebuild trust in America’s institutions, we have to make the bulk of people

believe

that those institutions are broadly free of discrimination.

How can that be accomplished? There’s no perfect solution. Even if institutions can be made more race-neutral and gender-neutral, the

memory

of the period of intense discrimination will persist for a long time. And opportunistic political agitators, amplified by social media, will continue to

tell

everyone that the system is unfair no matter how much we manage to curb the actual unfairness.

But I think there is one way we can make the system seem more fair, and that’s to aggressively and publicly

enforce the law

. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids racial discrimination, and in some cases the 14th Amendment does too. So the best solution, I think, is to have lots of high-profile legal victories that make it clear to all Americans that racial and gender discrimination are prohibited in the United States. I wrote about this back in May:

White Americans as a normal minority

Formal equality under the law does not guarantee actual fairness in society. The law is not all-powerful. But it’s a big loud public signal that says that the system disapproves of unfairness. Therefore, the best remedy for discrimination against White men is simply for White men who feel they’ve been discriminated against to

sue, and sue, and sue again

.

The alternative to individual fairness under the law is group racial conflict. If Americans decide that individual fairness is dead, and that their interests can only be served by collective racial “power” movements, then we will see the Republican party morph into a White power party, and the Democratic party morph into a “BIPOC” power party.

1

Racial bloc politics will be very bad for the country’s future.

America already has good laws that mandate individual fairness. If those laws can be enforced in a very public and unambiguous way, then I think we may still escape the dystopian future of racial conflict and balkanization.

In 2004,

The Economist

predicted

that India’s economic growth rate would overtake China’s in two decades. In 2010, in an article called “

India’s surprising growth miracle

”, they shortened that timeline dramatically, declaring that India might overtake China in terms of GDP growth as early as “2013, if not before”.

In the end, it took two years longer. Since 2015, India has been the world’s fastest-growing major economy, taking the crown from China:

Source:

@aravind

As

The Economist

noted, this is partly due to India’s more rapid population growth. If we want to look at living standards, we should look at per capita GDP (PPP). Here, India didn’t overtake China until after the pandemic:

India continues to turn in strong growth performances. In the third quarter of this year, it grew at 8.2%, up from 7.8% the previous quarter:

India’s population is growing at a little less than 1% a year, so this roughly corresponds to a per capita growth rate of around 7.2% or 7.3%.

That sort of growth rate is less than South Korea or China managed during their heydays of industrialization. From 1991 to 2013, China’s per capita GDP (PPP)

grew

at an annualized rate of 9.4%. But 7.2% would still be enough to utterly transform India in just a short space of time.

According to

the IMF

, India has a per capita GDP (PPP) of $12,101 as of 2025. Thirteen years of growth at 7.2% would bring that to $29,878 — a little higher than where China is today. That’s interesting, because India’s big economic reforms happened in 1991 — twelve years after China’s. Two decades of 7.2% growth would bring India to $48,609 — about as rich as Hungary or Portugal today.

In other words, if India keeps growing as fast as it’s growing right now, it will be a

developed country

before kids born today are out of college.

Consider even the more modest scenario in which India grows at the same rate it’s been growing over the past decade — about 5.4% in real per capita PPP terms. Fifteen more years of that growth rate would bring India to $26,633 — about where China and Thailand are today. Twenty years, and it would be $34,644 — about the same as Chile.

This is all a big “if”, of course. When I threw out some optimistic growth scenarios on X,

I was mercilessly mocked

:

But this critique is overdone. Yes, it’s likely that India, like China, and like every other rapidly industrializing country, will experience

a slowdown in growth

as it gets richer. But growth could also accelerate for a while. China’s growth slowed in the 1990s, but then accelerated in the 2000s after it joined the WTO:

Source:

World Bank

Growth is not always a smooth deceleration; sometimes it goes up for a while. And if Indian policy improves, it could see growth accelerate — or at least remain high as the country gets richer.

And India is still experimenting with policy reforms. Just the other day, it rolled out

a major reform of its sclerotic labor laws

:

India implemented overhauled labor laws that aim to attract investments and make it easier for companies to do business in the South Asian nation…The laws, grouped in four separate codes, replace archaic legislation and will give flexibility to companies to hire and fire workers, enhance safety standards and extend guaranteed social security benefits…

India’s maze of labor regulations, both at federal and state level, are considered to be rigid and complex, forcing companies to either remain small, employ fewer workers or use capital-intensive methods of production. The latest attempt is expected to make the rules uniform across the country[.]

Among other things, the new law

allows women to work night shifts

. This has the potential to help address India’s

glaringly low female labor force participation rate

. Most manufacturing miracles in history started with women migrating from farms to cities to work in labor-intensive light industry (garments, toys, electronics, etc.).

1

If India manages to unlock this classic labor resource, it could not only give India a stronger manufacturing base, but also improve the country’s

oddly low rate of urbanization

.

I don’t mean to claim that this labor law reform will propel India to two decades of 7% growth. By itself, it won’t. But it shows that India’s government is able to push through pro-growth reforms over the objections of incumbent stakeholders. And it shows that the government

cares enough about growth

to do this.

There’s a theory out there, espoused by

A.O. Hirschman

back in the 1950s,  that economic development creates political support for further development. Once the people of a country realize that rapid economic growth is

possible

, they may get used to the idea of their living standards increasing noticeably every year. On top of that, many elites become invested in the institutions of growth — owning construction companies, banks, and so on — and thus it’s in their interest for growth to continue.

Basically, this is the idea that Indians are not going to look back at two decades of fairly rapid growth — growth that has brought the country out of desperate poverty into lower-middle-income status — and conclude that

this was enough

. Instead, they may be willing to do the hard work of overruling vested interests — like the labor groups who resisted the recent labor law changes — in favor of reforms that promise to keep the economic party going.

Which other reforms would be key? For one thing, India needs to reform its financial system in order to help its companies scale up. The country currently has

a very high cost of capital

, meaning it’s hard for companies to borrow and grow.

Fixing bond markets

is one idea here, but most countries that experience economic growth “miracles” rely heavily on

bank finance

instead of on bond markets.

Beyond finance and harnessing rural women’s labor, there’s also probably a lot more India can do to boost their manufacturing sector. In a Noahpinion guest post this summer, Prakash Loungani and Karan Bhasin wrote down some ideas for how to do this:

What can India do to industrialize?

In a nutshell, their suggestions are:

Repeal regulations that specifically stop large manufacturing companies from firing employees

Repeal local laws that make it hard to convert agricultural land to industrial use

Conduct more trade agreements, e.g. with Europe

Reduce red tape for manufacturers

This brings me to another reason I’m bullish on India is that there’s still a huge amount of room for manufacturing to grow. Right now, despite being

the world’s fifth-largest manufacturer

, India is still a service-intensive economy — manufacturing is

only 13% of the country’s GDP

. This has led some people to conclude that India just isn’t a country that can make things, and that they should stick to services. But recently there have been some hopeful signs for Indian industry.

For one thing, manufacturing has already been key to India’s rapid growth over the past few years. Menaka Doshi

points out

that “corporate investment announcements between April [and] September are at a decade high of 15.1 trillion rupees, led by manufacturing firms.” And India’s exports, especially of electronics,

are rising

:

India clocked the highest goods exports for November in 10 years. Two factors seem to have helped the country counter

Trump’s 50% tariff

. Buoyant electronics exports, of which Apple iPhones are

expected to be the largest chunk

. And export diversification, including to China…November trade data…shows India’s exports

rose to $38.13 billion

— up 19.4% from a year earlier, the biggest jump since June 2022…

Earlier this year, Apple

expanded

iPhone production in India to fulfill the majority of US demand.

Apple, the world’s best electronics company, is steadily

moving more iPhone production

to India. That shift, which has been happening since the pandemic, has been helping to drive

an Indian electronics export boom

:

Source:

CEIC

The boom is still in its infancy, but this just gives it more room to grow. Right now, India’s electronics exports are mostly phones, but this just gives India the opportunity to expand into assembling computers and other electronics.

And while electronics assembly is the lowest part of the value chain, India may be climbing that ladder already. There are also reports that Apple is considering

making some of the

components

of the iPhone in India as well:

Apple is in preliminary talks with some Indian chip manufacturers to assemble and package the component for the iPhone, said people with knowledge of the matter, a move that would mark a key step up in the value chain for vendors to the tech giant…It’s the first time Apple is evaluating the prospect of having certain chips assembled and packaged in India[.]

Components — mostly semiconductors of various sorts — represent the bulk of the value in an iPhone or other piece of modern electronics. Packaging and testing chips is a much higher-value activity than simply slapping components together into a final product.

In fact, India has

recently focused

on promoting the chip packaging and testing industry, often by

soliciting foreign direct investment

in the sector. This was

how Malaysia became

an electronics powerhouse, helping to propel that country to a

GDP (PPP)

of almost $44,000. It’s a very good strategy for India.

In any case, India just looks like a very promising growth story to me. The country has already been growing at a decently rapid clip, and its income levels are still low enough that it has lots of room to catch up with the technological frontier. It has shown that it still has the political will to push through major reforms, and its manufacturing sector is improving and has plenty of space to grow. It has a huge domestic market that will help its companies achieve scale. It has plenty of elite engineers and such. And due to its democracy and general friendliness, it’s looking like a more attractive production base than China for many multinational companies like Apple.

So what’s the bear case here? What are the key arguments that India

can’t

grow to become a comfortably upper-middle-income country over the next two decades?

One common idea, expressed by former Singaporean Prime Minister

Lee Kuan Yew

, is that India will always be held back by internal fragmentation. Lee

called India

“not a real country”, “32 separate nations”, and “many nations along a British railway line”.

Linguistic fragmentation is certainly a challenge for India. But the country’s regions show no inclination to break away. And federalism can be a strength, too. There was

an interesting story in The Economist

recently comparing the economic growth models of Indian states Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Gujarat has focused on building infrastructure, and has pursued capital-intensive industries like chemical manufacturing; Tamil Nadu has focused on improving education and health, and has pursued labor-intensive industries like electronics assembly.

But while The Economist pits these models against each other, the truth is that it’s probably good for a country to have both. A complex, diversified economy

tends to grow faster

than one that focuses on a single narrow range of industries. If India’s states find different paths to success, that could make the Indian economy more resilient in some ways than China, which is currently

discovering the downsides

of having a strong government that tells every province to make the same things.

Another bear case for India is the idea that China will throttle India’s rise. The reigning industrial powers of the 20th century — the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Korea — were remarkably nice to China during its early industrialization, cheerfully opening their markets to Chinese products and setting up joint ventures to teach Chinese people how to make anything and everything.

But China, the current reigning industrial power, is unlikely to be so nice to India. As expert China-watcher Rush Doshi

explains

, China’s current leadership wants to monopolize global manufacturing now and for all time. That explains why as Indian electronics manufacturing has ramped up, China has tried to

block its engineers

from going to India to train their replacements. I wrote a post about this back in March:

China is trying to kneecap Indian manufacturing

But I don’t believe this will cripple India’s growth model. China isn’t the only country that makes things; there are plenty of engineers from South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the U.S., and Europe who can get Indians started making things. And as Xi Jinping’s regime continues to be repressive, and China’s growth continues to slow, lots of Chinese engineers will find ways to move to a country with more rapid growth and more personal freedom.

My guess is that the most important reason for widespread skepticism about India’s growth prospects is something that most people are too polite to say, except behind the shield of anonymity on a platform like X. A lot of people just don’t believe that Indians, as a people, have what it takes to build a modern high-tech economy. When I express optimism about India’s growth,

someone

always

chimes in

to say that Indians have low national IQ:

Let us set aside for a moment

the question

of whether national IQ studies are reliable. As the more circumspect of the two tweets above notes, cognitive ability and economic success are a two-way street. Though cognitive ability

probably does boost growth

, the reverse is also true — as countries get richer, they get

better nutrition

, more

schooling

, reduced

pollution

, and

air conditioning

, all of which contribute to better cognitive performance.

I view these discussions of IQ as a stand-in for something deeper — a suspicion that countries made up of people who aren’t of European or East Asian descent simply aren’t capable of building a wealthy, high-tech society. Although people of Indian descent have succeeded spectacularly in countries from the U.S. to Singapore to the UAE, no country in South Asia has reached upper-middle-income status — India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan are all still pretty poor. So because none of these countries

has

done it, a lot of people just assume that none of them

can

do it.

If you think about it, that assumption doesn’t make a lot of sense. Some country always has to be the first in its region to industrialize. Before Japan beat Russia in a war in 1905, Europeans didn’t think East Asian countries could become modern industrialized powers. And it wasn’t until the success of Japan’s auto and machinery industries in the 1970s that the world came to respect East Asian industrial prowess.

Nowadays, no one thinks it’s odd or unusual if an East Asian country gets rich; in fact, people suspect it. But there had to be a first country in the region to break old stereotypes and assumptions, and that country was Japan.

India is a much bigger country than Japan, which presents a challenge. It seems intuitively harder for a giant country like India to be the first in its region to break the old stereotypes and wow the world. But if you believe economists’ estimates, India is now

about as rich a country

as Japan was in 1962. The task is not insurmountable.

Call me crazy, but I think India can do it.

Commenter Jack Lowenstein

writes

:

As a long time India bull and former professional investor in listed equities there, I would add three points:

1) a positive byproduct of the high cost of capital is that ROEs are also high, and also that because debt capital is scarce, banks remain filters, not funnels. Nor does the Indian government coerce capital into SOEs.

2) fraud and corruption are often posited as negatives for the investment and growth story. However all though these are easy to find, I suggest India’s greater transparency compared to China, as made them less universal.

3) while many countries have great technical universities, I wonder if any have the level of competitive entry as the Indian Institutes of Technology. The nearest equivalent I can think of is French engineering schools.

(1) is an important point; at this early level of development, India needs to worry less about

allocating

resources and more about

mobilizing

resources.

(2) is interesting, because there’s

some work claiming

that China’s type of corruption — like America’s in the late 1800s — gave government officials an unofficial equity stake in development, and therefore encouraged development. It was “corruption”, but the kind of corruption that led to aligned incentives.

Meanwhile, India just

passed

another

big reform package

— this one about finance:

[L]awmakers passed a bill this week allowing up to 100% foreign ownership of

insurance firms

, bolstering an industry long viewed as under-penetrated and capital-starved. Regulators have also overhauled rules for

banks

,

pension funds

and

capital markets

as they aim to shift savings from idle assets such as gold and property toward equities, bonds and long-term investments to finance factories and infrastructure.

All these reforms come as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his administration want to make India a

developed economy

by 2047,

a goal that requires economic growth of about

8% per year

[.]

I’m especially excited about

the banking reform

, whose goal is creating larger banks while also increasing the number of banks in the country. Of all the reforms in the package, this one seems the most likely to have a major impact.

Note the importance of growth targets in pushing through this reform. If India hadn’t grown at 8% in some recent years, it seems unlikely the government would feel confident in setting 8% as a growth target. This suggests that growth is creating expectations for further growth, which is creating momentum for policy reform.

My book,

Weeb Economy

came out in March, but only in Japanese. Half of the book was

a series of translated posts

from my blog, so those are already in English. The other half was a new part that I wrote in English and had translated into Japanese by my excellent translator, Kataoka Hirohito. So while I’ll eventually republish the whole book in English, what I can do right now is to publish my English-language first draft as a series of posts on this blog.

The first installment was entitled “

I Want the Japanese Future Back!

”. In that post, I explained why Japan now finds itself in the position of a developing country, playing catch-up with other countries. This means Japan needs to experiment with bold new strategies and development models, as it did in ages past.

In this second installment, I suggest one such experiment: a huge increase in a kind of investment called

greenfield FDI

. I discuss:

How Japan is already benefitting from greenfield FDI in a few places

Why greenfield FDI (a foreign company building a factory or research center in Japan) is so much more important and useful than other kinds of FDI like mergers and acquisitions

Why Japan needs to export a lot more to other countries, and how greenfield FDI can help do that

How Japan can start to welcome more greenfield FDI

Why Japan is an attractive destination for international investment

The Kumamoto miracle points the way

The semiconductor industry is probably the most important industry in the world. Computer chips are absolutely essential to every high-value product in a modern economy — autos, rockets, appliances, machinery, everything. They’re also of crucial military importance, in an age where precision weaponry rules the battlefield. And they’re of core importance to emerging technologies like AI — whose vast computational resources require enormous data centers — and biotech.

As a result, it’s no wonder that the world’s major economies have been fighting over the semiconductor industry

for generations

. In the early days, the U.S. and Japan were the clear leaders. Much of the industry involves the design of semiconductors and the production of specialized tools and materials, and in these upstream parts of the industry the U.S. and Japan are still strong. But in the most important downstream part of the process — the actual fabrication of the most advanced chips — both the U.S. and Japan have

lost their lead to Taiwan

:

Source:

Statista

Specifically, they have lost their lead to one remarkable Taiwanese company: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.  TSMC are essentially the world’s greatest machinists. Other companies design the chips, and other companies create the (incredibly advanced) machine tools that make the chips. What TSMC does is to buy the tools, and then use the tools with incredible ingenuity and efficiency to make someone else’s chips designs into reality. They pioneered this “pure-play foundry” business model, and it has made them rich — and it has allowed Taiwan to outcompete the chipmaking industries of every other country on the planet.

Since the pandemic, the global battle to win semiconductor market share has intensified, due to the advent of AI and to the geopolitical competition between China and the democratic countries. Japan, like many countries, is trying to build its own foundry business, in the form of

Rapidus

, a joint venture between a bunch of Japanese companies that’s also getting some help from IBM. But — also like in the U.S. there’s also a second, parallel effort afoot. Japan is building chips for TSMC.

In late 2021, TSMC created a Japanese subsidiary called Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing (JASM), and started building two fabs in Kumamoto prefecture. Sony and Denso pitched in to help. So did the Japanese government, providing

billions of dollars in subsidies

and offering TSMC logistical assistance in finding local workers and ensuring adequate water and other infrastructure. The first plant was completed very quickly, and

opened in February 2024

; the second is expected to open in 2025. Now TSMC is

considering a third fab

in Kumamoto, producing even more advanced chips, to be opened in 2030.

Observers have been impressed with the speed with which the fab was built,

comparing it favorably

to TSMC’s plant in America, which initially suffered delays. TSMC

credited

the successful construction to a variety of local supporting institutions — “suppliers, customers, business partners, government and academia.” TSMC’s founder Morris Chang, who once

poked fun at Japan

for the slow speed of its business dealings, has now become a true believer in the revival of the country’s chip industry. At the opening of the first TSMC plant in Kumamoto,

Chang predicted

a “renaissance of semiconductors” in Japan.

And Japan isn’t stopping with TSMC. Micron, an American chip company, is

building a fab in Hiroshima

, bringing some of its best technology into the country.

Samsung is building

a semiconductor development center in Yokohama. Both of these investments are being done with significant help from the Japanese government, and involve cooperation with Japanese companies and universities.

These investments by foreign companies

aren’t Japan’s only strategy

for reviving its semiconductor industry — they coexist alongside homegrown efforts like Rapidus, as well as Japan’s upstream efforts in the chipmaking tool and materials industries. But they represent a crucial

addition

to the purely indigenous efforts. This is an example of multi-strategy development at work.

But it’s far from the only such example.

A school of AI fish

The artificial intelligence boom is the most important trend in the software industry right now. Whether this remains true in future years remains to be seen, of course, but the capabilities of large language models like ChatGPT, AI art software like Midjourney, and computer vision systems are undeniable. Even if there’s a bubble and bust in the field at some point — as there was with dot-com companies in 2000 — AI is going to be important in the long term.

Japan largely missed out on the internet software boom — the country has no internationally dominant consumer internet giants like Google or Facebook, and its B2B software industry was hampered by Japanese companies’ slowness to adopt IT solutions in past decades. But the AI age is a new dawn, and Japan has another shot at building a powerful software industry.

At the time of this writing, one of the most interesting AI startups in Japan is

Sakana AI

. Currently, AI applications generally use one large statistical model to generate text, create images, recognize objects, predict the shape of a protein, etc. Sakana tries to instead use groups of smaller models to accomplish the same thing. In addition to being able to do some things better than big models, these groups of smaller models may use much less electric power — an important consideration, when AI’s energy needs are skyrocketing.

Sakana AI has three founders. There’s Llion Jones, originally from Wales, who was one of the authors of the groundbreaking

2017 research paper

that discovered the algorithm now used to make LLMs. There’s David Ha, originally from Canada, who was an AI researcher at Google Brain. And there’s Ito Ren, a Japanese former diplomat who was an executive at the e-commerce company Mercari.

The company’s investors are equally international — it includes American venture capital firms like Khosla Ventures, Lux Capital, and New Enterprise Associates, the American semiconductor giant Nvidia, and a large assortment of Japanese banks and technology companies. Sakana’s most recent funding round raised $214 million, and valued the company at $1.5 billion.

That’s not a huge valuation compared to U.S. giants like OpenAI (

$150 billion

) or Anthropic (possible valuation of

$40 billion

). But Sakana’s presence has put Japan on the map as a potential hotspot for international AI investment. Nvidia, for example, has declared its intention to

create an R&D center

in Japan. OpenAI has opened

a branch office in Tokyo

. Oracle is

investing $8 billion

over the next decade in AI and cloud computing in Japan. This is in addition, of course, to all the big cloud providers — Amazon, Microsoft, and Google — looking to

invest in Japan

in order to serve the Japanese market.

Then there’s

Spellbrush

, a U.S. startup that has

a partnership

with the AI art and design company Midjourney. Spellbrush uses generative AI to create Japanese-style anime art — one of the most popular and lucrative applications for AI so far. Spellbrush recently opened a branch office in Tokyo’s Akihabara neighborhood.

Japan is still behind the U.S. and China in AI, but investments like these keep it in the game.

It’s important to note that although Sakana AI might succeed,

the most likely outcome is that the company will fail

. This is true because

most startups fail

in general, and because in a rapidly changing new industry like AI, the failure rate is likely to be even higher. In fact, the entire AI industry may be headed for

a significant bust

, like the dotcom crash in 2000.

But this shouldn’t negate the importance of Sakana, or of the Japanese AI boom in general. First of all, though most startups fail, the few that succeed often grow very large and important — venture investing is about accepting many failures in order to find a few huge wins. The investment and attention that Sakana draws to the Japanese AI startup scene will help make sure that some of those successes happen in Japan. Even a general AI bust will likely only be a temporary setback to the industry, as with the dotcom crash and the subsequent recovery.

Second, even failed startups often contribute crucial innovation to a country’s ecosystem. Fairchild Semiconductor wasn’t successful, but it pushed the envelope of semiconductor technology forward, and some of its alumni went on to

found Intel

. General Magic tried and failed to invent the smartphone in the 1990s, but its alumni went on to

help create the iPhone

.

And third, Sakana sends a signal that Japan is a viable destination for international investment in the software industry in general, well beyond AI. Japan is generally weak in most areas of IT, including B2B solutions, consumer internet companies, and cloud computing providers. As in semiconductors, a wave of foreign entrepreneurs and foreign funding could help Japan shore up its weak spot in software.

The most important kind of FDI

The chipmaking projects by TSMC, Micron, and Samsung, the U.S. VCs’ investment in Sakana AI, and the branch offices of companies like OpenAI are all examples of

foreign direct investment

, or FDI. But they’re not the only type, and when people talk about FDI, they often mean something very different. In fact, it’s actually a bit of a confusing term, because it encompasses multiple unrelated categories of investment. FDI includes:

Cross-border real estate purchases

Acquiring a foreign company (M&A)

Building a branch office or factory in a foreign country (“greenfield” investment)

Most writers who advocate for Japan to increase FDI focus on the second of these. They believe that allowing more foreign acquisition of Japanese companies will improve these companies’ productivity by transferring foreign management techniques.

I am agnostic concerning this argument. I recognize that Japan’s policymakers and businesses have many reasons for

resisting foreign acquisitions

, both as part of the country’s development strategy and part of its social policy. Foreign buyers might downsize Japanese companies by firing large numbers of employees, which would hurt Japan’s corporation-centric social welfare model. They might strip-mine Japanese companies for their technology or other assets and then sell them off as husks of their former selves, as happens

all too often

with leveraged buyouts in the United States. Or they might simply neglect their Japanese acquisitions until they stagnated.

Instead, my argument is that Japan should focus specifically on increasing and promoting

greenfield FDI

— foreign companies building their own branch offices and factories in Japan. And in particular, Japan should encourage

greenfield platform FDI

, in which a foreign company builds factories or offices in Japan in order to create goods and services that are then exported from Japan to a third country. TSMC’s chip fabs in Kumamoto are an example of greenfield platform FDI.

This particular kind of FDI offers a lot of benefits that foreign takeovers don’t. For one thing, greenfield FDI usually directly adds to the economy — when a foreign company builds a factory in Japan, or even just purchases office equipment for a new office, that represents real money that goes directly into Japanese people’s pockets. And greenfield FDI inevitably results in the hiring of more Japanese workers, since someone has to work at the new factory or office branch.

Investment spending and workers’ salaries in turn stimulate the surrounding local economy — already, Kumamoto is experiencing

an economic boom

. Note that M&A doesn’t necessarily accomplish any of this — it just changes ownership of existing businesses, without requiring any new investment, hiring, or spending on the local economy.

And greenfield FDI is also more likely to be received warmly by the Japanese public.

Ito, Tanaka, and Jinji (2023)

find that Japanese people feel more positively about greenfield FDI than about foreign acquisitions:

This study empirically examines the determinants of individuals’ attitudes about inward foreign direct investment (FDI) using responses from questionnaire surveys that were originally designed. Individuals’ preferences for inward FDI differ between greenfield investments and mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and people are more likely to have a negative attitude toward M&A than greenfield investments. People with a negative image of the so-called “vulture fund” for foreign capital tend to oppose inward FDI, and this is more pronounced for M&A than greenfield investments.

On top of all this, greenfield platform FDI has a very good economic track record. It has been key to the economic success of a number of developing countries — most notably China, but also

Poland and Malaysia

.

After China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, companies from around the world flocked there to set up factories — both to sell their products to a billion newly available Chinese consumers, but also to exploit what at the time were cheap Chinese labor, land, energy, and capital costs, in order to make products for export to the rest of the world. This is known as “platform FDI”.

Poland executed a similar strategy on a smaller scale, becoming a factory floor for European nations — especially Germany — looking for lower costs and more friendly regulation. Malaysia became a center of electronics manufacturing, with investments from the U.S., Singapore, Japan, and elsewhere. In both of these cases, the products of foreign-owned factories were largely sold abroad, since both Poland and Malaysia have relatively small domestic markets. FDI thus helped to make China, Poland, and Malaysia into export powerhouses.

Japan, of course, is in a very different economic situation than China, Poland, or Malaysia were in the 2000s. But it can still learn from their successes. In addition to the direct benefits for investment and employment, greenfield platform FDI offers two main advantages: it can increase a country’s

exports

, while also facilitating

technology transfer

. In its current economic situation, Japan could use a whole lot of both of these things.

Japan needs exports

Americans often think of Japan as an export powerhouse, because of the international success of brands like Toyota, Honda, Sony, and Panasonic. And during the early days of the postwar miracle, Japan’s bureaucracy did strongly encourage exports, in order to earn precious foreign currency. But in fact, this lingering stereotype is badly mistaken — Japan has never really been an export-oriented economy like Germany or South Korea. It’s a domestically focused economy, more like the United States:

Source:

World Bank

As Chalmers Johnson recounts in

MITI and the Japanese Miracle

, this inward focus was part of Japan’s development model in the 1960s. MITI found that ensuring cheap bank loans to domestic companies, and promoting competition in the domestic market, was a way to quickly boost Japan’s investment rate and its capital stock. And they found that this approach also ensured an adequate level of exports, since Japanese companies would produce more than they could sell in the domestic market, and export the excess capacity overseas.

Now, Japan finds itself badly in need of exports. The first reason is that

exports help increase the value of the yen

, making Japanese people richer as a result.

Japan’s currency has weakened dramatically against the dollar and other world currencies. This is partly because of Japan’s low interest rates relative to other rich countries, which is driven by Japan’s low inflation (and probably by a need to keep Japanese government borrowing costs low, in order to make Japan’s very large government debt sustainable).

As a result of the weak yen, Japanese people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford imports. Japan imports most of its food and energy, so the weak yen is increasing the cost of daily life. Japanese companies are having trouble importing the parts and materials they need, as well as energy. The Japanese government has been

forced to intervene

to prop up the value of the yen. But such interventions can’t last forever, since they require selling off foreign assets — eventually, the government runs out of foreign assets to sell, and the currency crashes even more.

An increase in global demand for Japanese exports can help increase the value of the yen. This is because in order to buy Japanese goods and services, foreigners need to swap their currencies for yen. This increases the demand for the yen, which pushes up its value. The more exports Japan sells, the stronger the yen becomes. Ultimately, Japan’s currency problem probably can’t be fixed by exports alone — financial outflows will have to be addressed as well. But exports help.

The second reason for Japan to focus on exports is that the domestic Japanese market is shrinking. Japan’s population is forecast to fall substantially over the remainder of this century:

Source:

Our World in Data

Mass immigration may slow this trend, and measures to increa

se the birth rate may eventually manage to reverse it. But whether that will ever happen is unknown, and even if it does, Japan will not be a major growth market for a long while. This means there is much less incentive for companies — Japanese or foreign — to invest in Japan in order to serve the domestic market than in the past. Less investment also means less spending on R&D, which causes Japan to fall behind technologically.

Exporting can help reduce this problem, or even solve it. The more Japan becomes an attractive platform for export production, the more reason there is for Japanese companies and foreign companies to invest in Japan, including investments in R&D and new technologies. This will help increase productivity.

Finally, the activities required to increase exports may improve productivity. There’s

a lot of research

on “learning by exporting” — entering foreign markets could teach Japanese engineers, product designers, and managers how to produce things that foreigners want to buy. This could help counter the so-called “

Galapagos syndrome

” — the tendency of Japanese product standards to drift away from international standards, shrinking the markets available to Japanese companies.

Another way to put this is that exporting allows companies based in Japan — whether domestically owned or foreign-owned — to achieve

scale

without exacerbating

competition

that drives down prices.

Greenfield platform FDI — like TSMC’s fabs in Kumamoto or American venture capitalists’ investment in AI startups in Tokyo — can help Japan become more of an export powerhouse.

Okubo, Wagner, and Yamada (2017)

find that foreign-owned factories in Japan tend to export more — and also to innovate more. Their explanations for the difference have to do with corporate governance and culture, and with the pool of employees that foreign-owned companies are able to hire. They write:

Foreign ownership may play a role in risk-taking choices of companies – such as exporting and innovating – for various reasons. It can provide companies with more information about the outside market, especially in the context of small and medium enterprises. Foreign owners may be keen on getting high returns on investment and may tolerate a higher risk level. Firms with foreign ownership may have greater access to funds. Also, firms that do allow foreign ownership may experience a more open corporate culture than firms that do not, and such open culture may facilitate risk-taking.

The simplest explanation here is that multinational companies — especially those with foreign employees — simply know a lot more about global markets. TSMC knows what kind of computer chips Nvidia and Apple want to buy. Sakana AI’s founders keep in touch with the American AI market, and understand what kind of capabilities U.S. companies want from AI models. And so on.

In other words, greenfield platform FDI is a perfect example of

multi-strategy development

. It means that instead of coming into Japan to compete with local companies in the Japanese market, foreign companies are helping Japan sell a bunch of new products to a bunch of new overseas customers.

The intangible benefits of FDI

Japan’s low levels of productivity are somewhat of a mystery to researchers.

Nakamura, Kaihatsu, and Yagi (2018)

, a trio of researchers from the Bank of Japan, arrive at the frustrating conclusion that the biggest problem is a lack of “intangible assets” at Japanese companies. These are any non-physical assets — brand reputation, patents, software, long-term customer relationships, management know-how, worker skills, tacit technical know-how, and so on.

This is such an enormously broad and heterogeneous category, and so many of its components are hard to measure, that “intangible assets” basically ends up becoming a label for economists’ ignorance about what makes some companies more valuable than others. For example, Nakamura et al. note that Japanese companies

spend quite a lot

on R&D, but don’t seem to get nearly as much value for their spending as U.S. companies do.

So the mystery remains a mystery. But even if we don’t quite know what the most important intangible assets are, we still might be able to help companies get more of them. Nakamura et al. suggest a fairly standard, reasonable list of approaches — increasing labor mobility, improving corporate governance, allowing more lagging companies to fail, and improving the venture capital ecosystem. These are all reasonable approaches, and — as we saw above — they’re all things that Japan is already trying to some greater or lesser degree.

But there’s one strategy that seems to be flying a bit under the radar here: FDI. When foreign companies put their factories, offices, and research centers in Japan, they bring many intangible assets with them — foreign management techniques, technical tricks and know-how, connections to customers and suppliers in other countries, and so on. And these can, for the most part, be pretty easily

transferred

to Japanese companies.

One way, which has been

thoroughly documented by researchers

, is through interactions with local suppliers. When a company like TSMC puts a semiconductor fab in Japan, one reason is so that it can buy a bunch of specialized tools and components from Japanese suppliers — like the photoresist that Japanese companies are so famous for. This in turn teaches Japanese suppliers what the leading chip companies need and how to best serve them, as well as details about how the best chipmaking tools work. Those kinds of knowledge are both intangible assets.

Another way ideas spread is through job-switching. TSMC’s fab is going to employ a bunch of Japanese workers. Those workers are going to get the chance to learn how to make chips from the very best in the business. If some of them eventually leave to go work at Japanese semiconductor companies, they’ll take all that knowledge with them. This sort of knowledge transfer would have been harder in the old days, when Japan was still under the lifetime employment system. But now, with mid-career hiring on the rise, it’s very likely.

Let’s imagine an example of how this might work. Suppose you’re a Japanese AI researcher at a domestic AI startup. You and your team know a lot about AI models, from reading research papers, from building them yourself, and maybe from going to some conferences overseas. But for some reason your models aren’t quite as good as foreign companies’ models. The foreigners must have a bunch of little tricks they use to make things work better.

Then one day your company hires another researcher who worked at Sakana AI. Your new colleague knows a lot of those tips and tricks for making models work more smoothly, from having worked with some of the top researchers at Sakana. And their time at Sakana also gave them personal connections with a bunch of other researchers overseas, whom you can now call up and ask for help solving your model’s problems.

Congratulations! You’ve just transferred tacit knowledge for free. Your company’s intangible assets have increased.

If this example sounds contrived, consider how many of Japan’s most famous inventions came through interaction with foreigners and absorption of foreign knowledge. Japan’s Canon

cooperated

with America’s Hewlett Packard in the 1980s to create laser printers. Yamaha

created

the digital synthesizer with the help of a Stanford engineer named John Chowning. The famous inventor Sasaki Tadashi licensed American patents to help him invent the first commercially viable pocket calculator.

Those are all examples from the book

We Were Burning

. In other words, in the 20th century, close links between Japan and the U.S. created a vibrant international research community, where ideas flowed back and forth across borders and across companies.

In fact, there’s evidence that this is a consistent pattern when it comes to FDI.

Todo (2006)

and

Kozo (2006)

both find that FDI consistently leads to positive productivity spillovers to the country that receives the investment, and that these spillovers are closely related to R&D spending.

Observers of the Japanese economy have noted with dismay how it seems to be losing human contact with other developed economies. Few Japanese people

study abroad

these days, and those that do tend to go only for a very

short period of time

. The number of Japanese young people who want to work abroad

has diminished

. Collaboration between Japanese scientists and their foreign counterparts

has decreased

, contributing to

a decline

in Japan’s high-quality research output. Even as the international research community has grown larger, Japan has been pulling away from it.

Greenfield FDI can help counter that increasing insularity, by bringing foreign researchers and managers into Japan, where Japanese people can absorb their knowledge without leaving the country.

Japan is welcoming the right kind of FDI, but it can do more

Why has greenfield FDI in Japan traditionally been very small? In the early days of its postwar miracle, Japan restricted all kinds of FDI for protectionist reasons, in order to reserve the domestic market for Japanese companies that were still in their early growth stages. This was a typical policy for the time, and not dissimilar from the “infant industry” protections used by the U.S. in its early development.

From the late 1960s through the early 1970s, Japan

significantly liberalized

its restrictions on FDI. There were still many institutional barriers to foreign acquisitions, mostly resulting from a combination of Japan’s financial and corporate governance systems, and from cultural resistance. But although foreign companies should, in theory, have had an easier time doing greenfield M&A from the 1970s onward, few took the plunge. There are lots of possible reasons for this — force of habit, regulatory differences between countries, cultural differences, and a general stereotype of Japan as a protectionist economy. But the most important reason was probably that unlike countries like China, Poland, or Malaysia, Japan simply didn’t try to

actively encourage

foreign companies to use it as a production base.

Since 2003, though, the situation has slowly changed. Former Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro

called for more FDI

into Japan. Regulations were eased a bit, and tax incentives were put in place. These efforts were minor and halting at first, but have gathered strength over time. Targets have become much more ambitious — in 2023 the government set a goal of

attracting 100 trillion yen of FDI

(about $690 billion as of this writing) by 2030.

Politicians

now talk regularly about the need to boost FDI. Immigration laws

have been changed

to make it much easier for skilled professionals to get permanent residency. There is a new Council for the Promotion of Foreign Direct Investment in Japan, and various other

government efforts to attract FDI

.

And amazingly, the plan seems to be working. In 2022, net FDI inflows to Japan were very slightly greater as a proportion of the economy than in either China or South Korea:

Source:

Our World in Data

And encouragingly, greenfield FDI seems to be powering this rise. The number of inbound M&A deals has

held steady

, while greenfield projects have soared:

Source:

JETRO

And since the semiconductor industry is powering this rise, it’s likely that a significant amount of this will result in exports.

But although this is good progress, Japan could do a lot more on the FDI front. First of all, 1.1% of GDP per year is a big improvement, but it’s not really big enough to be transformational —

Poland gets over 5%

, France gets 3.8%, and the U.S. gets 1.5%.

Second, most of Japan’s greenfield FDI is in one single industry — semiconductors. If Japan could attract similar levels of investment in other sectors, it would be insured against a sudden downturn in the chip industry, and it would have the chance to build up its technological muscle along a wider front. There are plenty of other high-value industries where Japan could be a high-tech, low-cost production platform — aerospace, biopharma, batteries, and electronics being four obvious examples.

In other words, Kumamoto, Sakana AI, and the other examples above are an important proof of concept for a golden age of Japanese FDI, but they should be only the beginning.

Why do foreigners invest in Japan?

Traditionally, the reason a few foreigners wanted to invest in Japan — either through greenfield investments or M&A — was to tap the large and lucrative Japanese market. That motivation still remains to some extent, but it’s growing weaker every day. But there are a number of reasons Japan is

increasingly attractive

as an export platform. Understanding these reasons is absolutely crucial for Japanese government officials and businesspeople who want to attract more FDI — if you’re selling something, you must understand why your customers want to buy it.

The most obvious selling point is the weak yen. A cheap Japanese currency makes anything produced in Japan more competitive in world markets. On top of that, decades of stagnant real wages have a silver lining — they’ve made Japan’s skilled workforce look relatively cheap. A third strong point is Japan’s deep network of high-quality suppliers.

There’s also the national security angle. As China’s foreign policy has become more aggressive, the U.S. and other developed nations have begun to try to move them out of China. The U.S. government calls this “friendshoring”, while companies call it “de-risking”, but the principle is the same — no one wants to be caught dependent on Chinese manufacturers for critical high-tech products if a war breaks out. Japan is

an obvious alternative

production base — it’s smaller and more expensive than China, but infinitely more secure. And unlike China, Japan will not

use espionage

to steal foreign companies’ intellectual property.

Even Germany, which has traditionally been more willing than other Western countries to invest in China, is beginning to get nervous; a significant number of German companies are

looking to switch to Japan

. And the U.S. Department of Defense is planning to

develop

advanced

weapons

in Japan, as well as manufacturing more

traditional munitions

there.

Yet another advantage — which Japanese people may not fully appreciate, since they’ve never had to deal with the alternative — is Japan’s efficient government. In many Western countries,

environmental review laws

and other poorly crafted regulations have turned land use into a nightmare — projects that pass all relevant environmental and safety regulations still have to endure years of lawsuits and court-enforced paperwork, making it hellishly expensive and time-consuming to build factories.

The U.S.

,

the UK

, and other anglophone countries, which rely on the courts to adjudicate environmental regulation, have become especially hostile to development.

Japan’s more sensible and efficient system, which relies more on bureaucrats than on the court system, preserves some role for community input, but allows construction projects to be approved in a timely manner. Japan’s willingness to build, meanwhile, has left it with plenty of high-quality infrastructure — and the ability to create more quickly to suit the needs of foreign investors if necessary.

But there’s one more huge reason that foreigners want to invest in Japan, which could ultimately be more important than all the rest combined. And it’s a factor that, in my experience, very few Japanese people — including the government officials tasked with

promoting FDI

— yet appreciate.

The key is that

people around the world really love Japan, and want to live there

.

(In Part III, I’ll explain why so many people in the world want to live and work in Japan — and how Japan can leverage this soft power to supercharge its FDI sector.)

Today at a Christmas party I had an interesting and productive discussion about AI safety. I almost can’t believe I just typed those words — having an interesting and productive discussion about AI safety is something I never expected to do. It’s not just that I don’t work in AI myself — it’s that the big question of “What happens if we invent a superintelligent godlike AI?” seems, at first blush, to be utterly unknowable. It’s like if ants sat around five million years ago asking what humans — who didn’t even exist at that point — might do to their anthills in 2025.

Essentially every conversation I’ve heard on this topic involves people who think about AI safety all day wringing their hands and saying some variant of “OMG, but superintelligent AI will be so SMART, what if it KILLS US ALL?”. It’s not that I think those people are silly; it’s just that I don’t feel like I have a lot to add to that discussion. Yes, it’s conceivable that a super-smart AI

might

kill us all. I’ve seen the Terminator movies. I don’t know any laws of the Universe that prove this

won’t

happen.

One response you can have to this is to conclude that because superintelligent AI might kill us all, that we should make very, very sure that no one ever invents it. This is the thesis of

If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies

, by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares:

This sort of reminds me of Gregory Benford’s famous admonition to “Never do anything for the first time.” You can make arguments for unforeseen catastrophic consequences for

lots

of different technologies. Nuclear weapons might kill us all of course, but so might synthetic biology or genetic engineering. Social media or other media technologies might collapse our societies. Video games might entrance us into virtual lives so that we never reproduce. In fact, it’s quite possible that universal literacy and reduced child mortality have

already

condemned humanity to

dwindle comfortably into nothingness

, with no artificial superintelligence required.

Personally, I do think that being so afraid of existential risk that you never invent new technologies is probably a suboptimal way for an intelligent species like ours to spend our time in this Universe. It’s certainly a

boring

way for us to spend our time; imagine if we had been so afraid that agriculture would kill us that we remained hunter-gatherers forever? My instinct says we should see how far technology can take us, instead of choosing to stagnate and remain mere animals.

But yes, OK, a superintelligent techno-god

might

kill us all. We can’t really know what it would want to do, or what it might be capable of doing. So if you really really want to be absolutely sure that no superintelligent techno-god will ever kill us all, then your best bet is probably to just arrest and imprison anyone who tries to make anything even remotely resembling a superintelligent techno-god. This is the approach of the Turing Cops in

Neuromancer

, the most famous cyberpunk novel.

And yet today at the Christmas party, against my better judgment, some people who think about AI safety for a living roped me into a serious discussion about their field of research. And to my utter astonishment, they actually thought I had some novel and interesting things to say.

If I can impress AI safety researchers with my thoughts on AI safety, I might as well write them up in a blog post. First, I’ll explain why I’m not very afraid that superintelligent AI will destroy humanity, and suggest some things I think we could do to minimize the risk that it will. And then I’ll explain what actually scares me about AI.

A week ago,

my friend Yaroslav requested

that I write more about economics and less about politics. So I deeply and humbly apologize to Yaroslav for writing another politics post.

In the past week or so, some people have claimed that the wheels are coming off the Trump presidency. For example, here’s

Max Burns, writing in

The Hill

:

It doesn’t take a political genius to recognize that things are in free fall over at the White House…Defense Secretary

Pete Hegseth

is facing

mounting Republican criticism

over a potentially illegal order to kill the survivors of a Caribbean boat strike. Attorney General

Pam Bondi’s

Department of Justice is in disarray after

three failed efforts

to prosecute former FBI Director

James Comey

and New York Attorney General Letitia James…Trump’s approval rating cratered to a new low of

just 36 percent

in late November following months of open-air dysfunction and his repeated failure to address fundamental problems like

rising consumer prices

.

It’s true that Trump has had a string of setbacks recently. Indiana

rejected Trump’s proposed redistricting plan

, which would have used gerrymandering to give the GOP 2 more seats in Congress. The GOP-dominated Indiana state legislature openly defied Trump’s

threats to cut off the state’s infrastructure funding

unless they accepted the gerrymandering plan. It was a pretty

remarkable act of defiance

from state-level Republicans, and could indicate that Trump’s power to bully his own party into line is eroding.

Meanwhile, Democrats have been

performing strongly in off-year elections

:

Democrats were declared winners of the Miami mayor’s race

for the first time in nearly 30 years

, winning the race easily by 18 points. And…the party also

flipped a Georgia state House district

that Trump had carried by double digits last year…The results in Miami and Georgia were merely the latest in

a series of ominous signs

for the GOP’s electoral picture…Democrats also flipped the mayor’s race in suburban Roswell…Democrats…continue to over-perform in special elections by

more than they ever have in the Trump era

…when the districts have been somewhat competitive, the results have been strong for Democrats. This year they’ve flipped four state legislative seats that had favored Trump by double digits a year ago…Democrats have now flipped more of these seats in special elections than in any year since 2020, when they won back the presidency.

This presages a potential blue wave in the 2026 midterm elections, which is undoubtedly why Trump is so desperate to push through state-level gerrymandering plans.

These concerns were bolstered by

a recent AP-NORC poll

that had some very poor numbers for Trump, including on the economy and on immigration — the two main issues that Trump won on in 2024:

Source:

AP

Source:

AP

These developments do seem to reinforce the notion that Trump’s post-election honeymoon is over. But I wouldn’t be too quick to label him a lame duck, or to conclude that his power over the GOP is breaking.

Americans are grumbling, but not yet raging

First of all, the AP poll is just one poll. Overall, Trump’s approval rating has drifted downward, and he had a bad November, possibly because of the government shutdown. But since the shutdown ended, his approval has rebounded somewhat, and is still above 40% in the poll averages:

Source:

Nate Silver

And while it’s true that Democrats will probably do well in the midterms — as the opposition party often does — a Democratic victory in Congress would not make Trump a lame duck. Democrats will not get a two-thirds supermajority, so they will be unable to override Trump’s vetoes. This means their ability to curtail Trump’s power — for example, by revoking his tariff authority — will be limited. And Trump has mostly governed by executive order in any case; Congress can pass laws that supersede the EOs, but again, not without a supermajority.

As for immigration, it’s not clear how much Trump’s deteriorating approval rating on that issue will hurt him. Those lower numbers are probably a response to the steady drumbeat of stories and videos of ICE

apprehending and detaining U.S. citizens

,

demanding that citizens carry “immigration papers”

, and generally

treating people badly

. But there has been no wave of popular unrest in response to those abuses, as there was to videos of police shootings in the 2010s. Overall, Americans appear to

still be exhausted

from a decade of street conflict.

And Trump still gets decently high marks on border security, as distinct from immigration overall:

Source:

AP-NORC

It’s not clear whether voters care about “immigration” or “border security” more; it’s possible that many voters view Trump’s ICE raids and illegal renditions with distaste, but are willing to forgive those excesses because Trump delivered on his core promise of securing the border:

Source: CBS via

the White House

It’s possible that the racial profiling inherent in Trump’s ICE raids will drive away the Latino voters that began to join the Republican coalition in 2020 and 2024. In fact, Trump’s approval

is slipping with Latinos

. But for now, the immigration issue doesn’t seem to be a big liability for Trump.

And many of Trump’s other outrages, missteps, and bad policies simply don’t seem to be breaking through to the public consciousness. Avid news-readers might be aghast at

Trump’s attempts to bully Ukraine

into accepting an unfavorable peace deal, or at Pete Hegseth’s probably-illegal

orders to massacre people on boats

in the Caribbean. They might be disturbed by Trump’s plans to

sell advanced Nvidia chips to China

, or by rumors of

an invasion of Venezuela

. They might be outraged at any of the administration’s numerous

corruption scandals

. But a lot fewer Americans are reading the news:

Source:

Pew

It seems to me that people can get mad about A) outrages they read about in the news, and/or B) bad stuff that happens to them in real life. With Americans tuning out the news after a turbulent decade, there is simply less scope for (A). That leaves (B). And most of the bad things Trump is doing have little or no immediate ramifications for the daily lives of average Americans.

I said “most”, but not “none”. One possible exception is the

measles epidemic

, which is now affecting thousands of people in South Carolina and causing hundreds more to be quarantined. This is a purely manmade epidemic; measles can be eliminated by widespread vaccination, and in fact was declared eliminated in the U.S. for many years. Now, because some Americans are choosing to

forego the vaccine

, the country is on track to

lose its measles elimination status

.

Source:

Simon Kuestenmacher

RFK Jr., Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services, has

spread falsehoods about the measles vaccine

, and even Fox News is

blaming him for the outbreak

. So if the disease keeps spreading, this is one thing that could disrupt normal Americans’ daily lives and cause them to sour further on Trump.

But by far the biggest thing that affects Americans’ daily lives — and where they seem to be souring on Trump’s rule — is the economy.

Trump’s economy

Americans are very, very unhappy with the state of their economy right now. Consumer sentiment is even worse now than at the lowest point in the Biden administration:

Source:

UMich

Why are Americans upset about their economy right now? Because they feel like life is getting less affordable. Polls pretty consistently show that the cost of living

tops all other concerns

:

Source:

Lakshya Jain

And Americans increasingly seem to blame Trump for this:

Source:

Politico

Is the

affordability crisis

real? Well, it depends on your perspective. Real wages for production and nonsupervisory workers — i.e. wages adjusted for the cost of living — are a good measure of purchasing power. And these have been rising steadily since 2022, meaning that life in America has been getting more affordable — at least, on average.

And although inflation is a tiny bit above target and may be rising again, it’s still far lower than in 2021-22, and pretty low by historical standards:

Why are Americans so apocalyptically negative about affordability in the Trump economy, when the objective indicators seem fairly benign? There are lots of possibilities here. People might be

mad about high mortgage rates

that make it hard to buy a new home. They might be finally venting their rage over

decades of rising costs

for big-ticket service items like health care, college, and child care (even though many of those costs seem to have

plateaued or even decreased

in the last few years). They might simply be using inflation as a politically neutral-sounding way to express their disapproval of Trump on sociocultural issues.

One possibility is that Americans are mad that Trump just doesn’t seem to care about affordability. His tariffs are probably contributing a relatively modest but real amount to inflation:

Source:

Econofact

And when confronted about rising prices from tariffs, Trump has responded by sneeringly

telling Americans to be satisfied with less

:

“Be satisfied with fewer toys for your kids” is not the kind of message Americans like to hear, especially from a guy who lives a

lavish, super-rich lifestyle

. Trump has also called the affordability crisis “a hoax.”

CNN has

poll results

showing that it may be Trump’s perceived inactivity and lack of sympathy on affordability that is angering some voters:

[I]mportantly, a large reason for that negativity [about the economy] appears to be not just the state of affairs, but Trump’s perceived neglect…Recent polling

from CBS News and YouGov

shows 75% of Americans and 57% of Republicans say the administration hasn’t focused enough on lowering prices. Again, that’s a clear majority … of Republicans.

And Trump’s macroeconomic policy threatens to make the situation even

worse

. He

consistently calls

for the Fed to cut interest rates more. Rate cuts would, of course, fuel inflation, especially if they convinced American business that Trump’s Federal Reserve no longer prioritizes price stability.

Why does Trump want rate cuts? Well, lower rates push up the value of stocks, bonds, and other financial assets, which Trump and his family own a lot of. This motivation might be why Trump’s Treasury Department is tweeting out charts touting bond price increases in 2025:

Of course, bond prices go

up

when interest rates go

down

. And interest rates typically go down when the economy is in distress. Just look at the chart and realize that the only other blue bar besides 2025 is 2020, when the pandemic was raging.

It’s possible that Trump’s macroeconomic team is just confused, and doesn’t know how any of this works. But it’s also possible that they value interest rate cuts as an inherently positive, good thing.

It’s also possible that Trump still views

unemployment

, rather than inflation, as the main threat to the U.S. economy. The labor market is

still fairly strong, but deteriorating

mildly, with

rising layoffs

. And right now the AI boom is propping up the macroeconomy; if that boom goes bust, the resulting financial and economic crisis could cause unemployment to soar. Trump may be trying to get ahead of that scenario. Or he may simply have an instinct that tells him that price hikes are less important than jobs.

Either way, Trump’s nonchalant attitude toward inflation could end up being his undoing. So far we haven’t seen any event that hurts lots of Americans and causes Trump to lose popular credibility, as Hurricane Katrina did to George W. Bush in 2005. A rise in inflation could be that event.

So while Trump’s presidency isn’t headed for the ash-heap of history just yet, it is showing major signs of strain. If Trump keeps abusing and hollowing out the economy, eventually some sort of strain or shock will be able to tip it into crisis.

The U.S. has arrested Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.

Then, in a press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump said the U.S. would “run” Venezuela “until such time that we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition.”

When Trump enraged the D.C. establishment by renaming the Kennedy Center, writes Kat Rosenfield, critics of the president presented “a binary choice for artists: cancel your Kennedy Center appearance as an act of resistance, or take the stage and be labeled a collaborator.” It’s not quite that simple.

‘Marty Supreme’ Is a Victim of Its Own Hype

Suzy Weiss

“It’s a lot of sizzle for not much steak.” That’s Suzy Weiss’s verdict on “Marty Supreme,” the Ping-Pong biopic that Timothée Chalamet is hoping will earn him an Oscar. During the publicity campaign, he’s done some hysterical things to persuade onlookers that he’s a star for the ages; don’t miss Suzy’s assessment of his performance, on-screen and off.

Eileen

,

by Ottessa Moshfegh. It’s about a strange young woman who works at a boys’ prison and dreams of life in the big city. That is, when she’s not dealing with her paranoid alcoholic father or stalking one of the guards she has a crush on. When the prison hires a glamorous new counselor called Rebecca Saint John, Eileen thinks she’s finally made a friend. But things get very strange from there. Come for the freak factor, stay for the twist ending.

Preacher’s Daughter

, which is about a teenage runaway who falls victim to a cannibalistic serial killer. Nobody ever really thought to make Southern Gothic pop before, and thank God someone finally has. If you’ve ever wondered what handing Flannery O’Connor a synthesizer might have resulted in, this is for you.

https://www.thefp.com/p/would-trump-really-attack-iran-again,No Title,,2026-01-04T04:10:36.899823,Eli Lake,"President Donald Trump shocked the world on Friday when he threatened to attack Iran’s regime if it sends its goons to fire on demonstrators who have filled streets across the country over the past week.

“If Iran shots [

sic

] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,” the

president posted

on Truth Social. “We are locked and loaded and ready to go.”

The threat might prompt more than a little whiplash for anyone who’s followed recent Trump administration statements on foreign policy. An intervention in Iran would clash with the spirit of the

National Security Strategy

the administration released last month, which dismissed past U.S. efforts to challenge Middle Eastern governments as a “misguided experiment” and chided past presidents for trying to force countries in the region into “abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government.” The Strategy mentions Iran only three times: once to credit Trump with brokering a ceasefire to end the 12-day war in June, and twice more to proclaim that the Islamic Republic is considerably weaker as a result of Israel’s and America’s bombing of the country’s nuclear and defense architecture.",https://www.thefp.com
https://www.thefp.com/p/brigitte-bardot-is-dead-why-are-we,No Title,,2026-01-04T04:10:38.419368,Kara Kennedy,"Brigitte Bardot has a neckline named after her, an off-the-shoulder cut that exposes your shoulders and collarbones and that signals a kind of sun-warmed carefreeness, a look that screams sex without strain. The silhouette is still sold every summer by designers who use Bardot’s name and image as cultural shorthand for relaxed, unapologetic sensuality, whether or not they care to acknowledge the woman herself. When she died this week, it was a reminder that certain people with certain beliefs must be disposed of carefully.

True, it’s hard to sum up Bardot’s legacy. There’s so much of it. In the early 1960s, Bardot ranked among the highest paid actresses in France, an international box-office draw whose films reshaped Europe’s understanding of female sexuality. As a singer, her collaborations, most famously “Bonnie and Clyde” with Serge Gainsbourg, defined a particular strain of French pop. Then, in the second half of her life, she turned away from the arts and devoted herself almost exclusively to

animal-rights activism

, founding the Brigitte Bardot Foundation in 1986 and

insisting repeatedly

that this—not her films, her lovers, or her looks—was how she wished to be remembered.

Nevertheless, in the wake of her death, she was mostly remembered for something else—as a quick scroll through the headlines can attest. From

The

Guardian

: “Brigitte Bardot’s image complicated by her controversial politics.” And

The

New York Times

: “Brigitte Bardot’s Legacy of Racist Rhetoric.” Here’s France’s most popular newspaper,

Le Monde

: “Brigitte Bardot’s 30 years of sympathy for the far right.” And finally

Euronews

: “Should France honour Brigitte Bardot? And if so, how? A nation divided.”",https://www.thefp.com

Old School

host Shilo Brooks to reflect on reading, and how the right books can change our lives.

I wasn’t much of a reader as a boy. On the weekends, my father insisted that my brother and I read for at least one hour on both Saturday and Sunday. He would send us up to our shared room, where my older brother, who was more academic than I was, would pore over

Encyclopedia Brown

novels, while I would only pretend to read, paging through

The Boy’s King Arthur

because it had cool illustrations.

This pattern persisted until I was 11, when I had what I consider my first great reading experience.

My father had assigned me a book,

Ender’s Game

, the science-fiction classic by Orson Scott Card. Every Saturday and Sunday, he’d send me up to my room to make progress on the novel, which is the story of a 6-year-old boy, Ender, who is recruited into an intergalactic war. At an excruciatingly slow pace, I dragged my way through the first hundred or so pages, spending most of that hour staring out the window or secretly surfing the web on our 56K dial-up modem. I wasn’t really giving the book a chance.

After a few weeks—a pace at which any reasonable person would’ve made it through the book—my father asked me how it was going. I fibbed, telling him I was almost done and would likely finish that day. When the hour was up, and I came out of my room, my father was waiting for me.",https://www.thefp.com

Forbes

had named her the

world’s youngest female self-made billionaire

—ahead of Taylor Swift!—she thought it was some kind of a joke.

“People come up with so much shit now that I assumed it was false,” Lopes Lara told me as she sipped sauvignon blanc in a wine bar in the West Village. “I’m a big Taylor fan, so any headline with my name and Taylor’s is like the craziest thing I’ve seen in my life.”

It was 5:30 p.m., an early hour to end the workday—except that Lopes Lara was planning to return to work after our meeting and not finish until 10, her usual schedule. That Lopes Lara would, at age 29, be in the exalted company of Taylor Swift was not exactly something that she had predicted. But as I listened to her explain her childhood, her current success made perfect sense. As a young girl in Brazil, she placed next to her bed a list of some of the people she hoped to emulate, including Winston Churchill,

This Privacy Notice (“

Substack Privacy Policy

to provide clarity about the personal data we receive from Substack and collect or process independently of Substack, whether through

www.thefp.com

Please review the

Substack Privacy Policy

to learn how Substack handles your name, email and any other identifiable information you provide when you use the Services. Contact Substack with any questions or requests about that information.

This Notice is grouped into these sections:

Scope of Notice;

Information we receive & why we use it;

Our exchanges of information to others;

Your privacy options.

Updates

: Because the Services change often, this Notice may change over time. Anytime we modify the Notice, we will post a revised version on the Services as noted at

Last Update

above. If we make material changes to how we collect or process personal information, we will try to notify you, so you have time to review them. If we have your contact information (such as your email), we’ll try to notify you that way. We may also post a temporary notice on the Services, or notify you by other means to the extent required by law.

Check the

Last Update

periodically to ensure you’re aware of the current Notice.

We encourage you to read this Notice carefully. By using or accessing the Services, you signify that you have read, understand and agree to the processing described in this Notice.

Scope of Notice

This Notice is designed to explain the information we receive, whether from Substack or a service provider, and provide direction about where you can control your privacy. Because we collect very little personal information, we begin with an explanation of the data that falls outside of our control on the Services:

Substack & account providers

As a reminder, TFP doesn’t collect any identifiable information from you. Substack, the content platform that administers and manages user access and subscriptions, may collect your name, contact information or billing or payment information. While we may receive some of that information, Substack controls it, and the

Substack Privacy Policy

explains that collection and your rights and choices in that information.

Analogously, if you are presented with the opportunity to subscribe to TFP through another platform like the Apple App Store or Google Play, your subscription will be administered and controlled by that provider, and we may receive some of it from the provider who controls it.

Outside services

The Services also link to, embed, integrate or otherwise connect you with third-party websites, services or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by TFP (“

Outside Materials

”).

Outside Materials are not part of the Services. This Notice doesn’t encompass information you may exchange with providers of Outside Materials. Those third parties have their own policies and practices about data. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy notices and applicable contractual terms.

For example, the Services may embed outside content like YouTube videos and X posts. Unlike our videos and podcasts, that third-party content is Outside Materials

For example, YouTube controls the embedded player containing a YouTube video. If you interact with the YouTube video, YouTube decides the data it will require before YouTube will serve its video to you.

When you interact with embedded Outside Materials, the player that contains the content may request information about you, such as your originating IP address or preexisting identifiers the provider has placed on your device.

For example, YouTube’s container may pull Google identifiers and data about you from cookies placed on your device by other web activity (like the Google Doc you looked at yesterday). The player may also collect information about your current URL of your browser (a page on our Services), without the involvement of our Services.

In practice, although our Services don’t use your information to facilitate targeted advertising, Outside Materials may do that. As a result, their providers may use information about your interactions with Outside Materials on www.thefp.com to inform the ads presented to you elsewhere online.

Contact us

If you have any questions or concerns that relate only to personal information we control, contact us at product@thefp.com.

Information we receive & why we use it

We receive information that Substack, its third-party service providers and our service providers collect and process when you interact with the Services. This includes:

Information you submit or provide directly

Data collected automatically by various technologies (which we call “Usage Data”).

The following tables describe, comprehensively, the information we receive through the Services, how we use it and why we process it.

Information You Submit

Usage Data

Any personal information that TFP obtains from third-party sources, including our service providers, will be processed by TFP in accordance with this Notice and all applicable laws. For example, our use and transfer of information via Google APIs will adhere to the

Google API Services User Data Notice

, including its Limited Use requirements.

Technologies we use

When you use and interact with the Services, software automatically collects Usage Data. The Substack Privacy Policy describes software like cookies and pixel tags deployed on all Substack-administered websites. The TFP app also includes technologies to collect Usage Data:

App Technologies, Customization, and Usage

Our apps collect information about your installation, use, and updating of our apps as well as information about your device, including your unique mobile device identifier (“UDID”) and other technical identifiers. More specifically, these tracking technologies allow us to collect data about your device and your use of our apps and content you interact with.

These app-based technologies cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our apps may include third party SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server, and is in effect the app version of a pixel. These SDKs allow us to track our conversions and communicate with you across devices, bring you advertising both on and off the Services, customize the app to your interests and preferences and link such across platforms and devices.

Information exchanged with others

This section describes how and why we exchange personal information with contractors and third parties. It also describes exchanges made for certain purposes, like legal reasons and consensual direct marketing. We may also disclose deidentified and/or anonymized data for these purposes.

We do not ‘sell’ or ‘share’ personal information

That means TFP doesn’t provide or exchange your personal information with others to facilitate behavioral ads (i.e., ads targeted to you) or otherwise sell it, except as described under With your consent or at your request below. For clarity, we haven’t shared or sold any personal information for that purpose in the past twelve (12) months.

Functional disclosures

We also contract with other businesses to provide certain services related to the functionality and features of the Services, including payment processing, email and hosting services, software development, shipping and fulfillment, data management, and administration of contests and other promotions. We refer to them as “

contractors

.”

Contractors may collect information about you on our behalf, such as Personal Identifiers, Commercial Information, Internet Activity and Device Information, as necessary for them to perform their services. At other times, we disclose information about you to contractors.

Contractors are not permitted to use information about you for any purpose other than performing their services for us. In the past twelve (12) months, we have exchanged these types of information with the following types of contractors:

Analytics providers, namely Google Tag Manager and Mixpanel, to tell us how the Services and our content are performing, such as which articles interest visitors and how long they visit before leaving. Among other data, they may receive your IP address and generate identifiers associable with your visits.

Various hosting services and data processors to provide the infrastructure of the Services, such as Sentry and Cloudflare, which ensures that traffic is from real people, not computers. Among other data, they may receive your IP address.

With your consent or at your request

We may periodically ask for your consent to share your contact information to third parties. Whenever we ask your consent for this reason, we will summarize the purpose and scope of the disclosure. For example, we may offer discounts to you if you consent to join our mailing list or participate in a promotion involving direct marketing communications.

In those cases, the Services will display a tickbox near an email-entry field explaining that by submitting your information, you agree to share your email with the content provider.

To be clear, we only exchange information about you with third parties for direct marketing purposes if you opt in, and will only do so until you opt out.

For legal reasons

Finally, we may disclose personal information:

In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us;

When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others; and in connection with the enforcement of our Terms and other agreements; or

In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.

How long we retain your information

We retain your information only as long as we need it for the purposes described under

Information we receive & how we use it

, except when longer retention is required by our compliance policies and efforts toward applicable legal, tax, accounting and regulatory requirements. Most usage data, as received by us, is deidentified to begin with.

How long we need information for those purposes varies by category, and even within categories. These retention determinations always consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from its unauthorized use or disclosure and whether we can achieve those purposes without using the personal information.

Use by minors

The Services are intended for adult users. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 16, and we do not share or sell information about anyone under 16 without affirmative authorization. If we learn that we have collected information from a person under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

If you are under 16: sorry, but please leave the Services. If you are a parent or guardian of a person under 16 years of age and you believe that person provided identifiable information while using the Services, please

contact Substack.

In Raise Your Threshold For Accusing People Of Faking Bisexuality

,  I cited a study finding that most men’s genital arousal tracked their stated sexual orientation (ie straight men were aroused by women, gay men were aroused by men, bi men were aroused by either), but women’s genital arousal seemed to follow a bisexual pattern regardless of what orientation they thought they were - and concluded that although men’s orientation seemed hard-coded, women’s orientation must be more psychological. But

Ozy cites a followup study

showing that women (though not men) also show genital arousal in response to chimps having sex, suggesting women’s genital arousal doesn’t track actual attraction and is just some sort of mechanical process triggered by sexual stimuli. I should not have interpreted the results of genital arousal studies as necessarily implying attraction.

Response To Alexandros Contra Me On Ivermectin

, I went over Alexandros Marinos’ very comprehensive criticism of my ivermectin post, attempting to show it made many mistakes. Some of his claimed mistakes I think he is wrong about and I continue to defend my previous position; others are already listed here. But a few are new. I won’t go through all of them here, but one especially serious one: I said an ivermectin study (Biber et al) had failed to report its primary endpoint, listed irrelevant endpoints to make up for that, deviated from its preregistration, and would have had null results if the preregistration had been followed. In fact, it reported its primary endpoint just fine, the endpoint was significant, and the deviation from preregistration was reasonable and not a major factor in the study. I described the study incorrectly (and very unfairly negatively) and incorrectly dismissed its results as useless.

A Columbian Exchange

, I related as true a story about Columbus cutting off the hands of Indians who didn’t give him enough gold as a tribute. Commenters convinced me that the story was false-ish: Columbus was known to punish Indians who didn’t give him enough gold, hand-cutting-off was a punishment commonly used elsewhere in Spanish America for this situation, but there is no hard evidence Columbus used it. Some other bad things Columbus did seem on firmer ground; see

Oh, The Places You’ll Go When Trying To Figure Out The Right Dose Of Escitalopram

, I treated a study that assumed a certain dose equivalent for antidepressants as proving that dose equivalent. As far as I know nobody has proven dose equivalents directly, and people look at indirect comparisons to create a conventional wisdom.

48:

(6/12/22) Also related to ivermectin: Alexandros Marinos

discusses many concerns

about my portrayal of Dr. Flavio Cadegiani. I acknowledge two of them as relevant and problematic: first, I noted that he was accused of “crimes against humanity” in a way that suggested the Brazilian government might think he was killing his patients (although I said I didn’t agree with this interpretation). A new source that wasn’t available to me at the time explains that the “crimes against humanity” accusation is because he didn’t stop a trial when it showed the experimental drug was much more effective than the placebo drug (which is a nonsensical accusation, since the accusers don’t believe this is true anyway). Second, although I said he was “involved in a scandal” where the Brazilian government made a defective app, his only “involvement” was that the app used his data; he was not responsible for any of the defects. I cannot remember why I made this error but I assume I saw someone else say something about this and didn’t dig deep enough to be fair to him. I regret both errors. Marinos has other concerns he thinks are relevant which you can find at the article.

47:

(6/5/22) In

this post

, I characterize California gubernatorial candidate Michael Shellenberger as opposing suboxone treatment and supporting “sweeping” institutionalization of the mentally ill, based on some articles about him. Shellenberger

rejects

both characterizations and says he supports the former and opposes the latter. I apologize for the false characterization.

Update

(6/22/23): After reading Shellenberger’s book San

Fransicko

(

review and discussion here

) I believe my original characterization was correct, and Shellenberger’s claim to reject this was false. This was not a mistake, and it was a mistake to categorize it as a mistake.

46:

(5/31/22) In

this post

, I discussed many statistical issues around ivermectin. Around the middle, I did two analyses of studies using a t-test.

A reader suggested

that it would have been more appropriate to use a meta-analysis test (eg Dersimonian-Laird). This would have strengthened the two analyses from marginally significant to clearly significant. More recently,

another reader has commented

that a DerSimonian-Laird test is

also

inappropriate because the studies aren’t homogenous, and now I’m not sure

which

test is appropriate or what result it would give - but it definitely wasn’t the one I originally tried. This doesn’t dramatically alter the overall conclusion of the post, which was that the apparent effect (whether marginal or clear) was better explained by other things.

45:

(5/18/22) In

this post

, I reported a survey of nootropics I had conducted. Among the most interesting findings: people found a supplement called Zembrin to be very effective. I reported this and suggested it might be helpful for people. A

later survey

failed to replicate people finding Zembrin especially effective. I’m still not sure what went wrong here, but my suggestion that people try it was probably wrong.

44:

(2/22/22) Many arguments on this month’s

Links

, of which the only one I really feel like convinced me of a mistake involved

this Snopes page

. I made fun of it for “debunking” the claim that the Biden administration distributed crack pipes to advance racial equity, when they did in fact distribute the crack pipes. But commenters convinced me that other people cared a lot about the “for racial equity” part. They were not distributing the crack pipes specifically to advance racial equity in particular, and I guess Snopes can consider it worth debunking this.

(2/19/22) In my prediction market post

The Passage of Polymarket

, I said that the government had ignored Philip Tetlock’s superforecasting work. Aftagley corrected me

here

, I unreflectingly believed another source that said charter city project Praxis was backed with $10 million from Peter Thiel. They reached out to say that they were backed by $4 million from Pronomos Capital, a fund affiliated with many people, of whom Thiel should not have been particularly relevant here.

(11/22/21) In my post on

FDA approval of Paxlovid

, I said that since the studies clearly showed Paxlovid was safe and effective, the FDA had no excuse for delaying its approval. Commenters pointed out that FDA approval also involves making sure the manufacturing process is safe. I admit the FDA has an excuse.

(8/28/21) In my post on

the California governor election

, I made fun of the California Democratic Party for refusing to field any candidates in the Newsom recall election, suggesting this was an obvious own-goal. Commenters pointed out that they’d

tried the opposite strategy in 2003

and it had been a disaster, since the presence of acceptable replacement candidates had made Democratic voters feel more comfortable voting for recall. I was wrong to dismiss this strategy as obviously stupid, and have edited the post to reflect that.

(8/8/21) In my post on

psychedelics and anosmia

, I said that a phenomenon couldn’t be explained by neurogenesis, since that mostly did not happen in adults. Commenters found that it at least happens in the olfactory bulb, which was the area under discussion. I still don’t think it’s relevant to that phenomenon, but this particular reason was definitely wrong.

37:

(8/6/21) In my

post on aducanumab

, I argued that the FDA had failed by delaying the approval of a fish-oil based nutritional solution. I got some key points wrong, and two days later I looked into it further and published

a separate post

with the full story. Some of the specific points I was clearly wrong about include:

I originally incorrectly said the fish oil helped the development of the nervous system; actually, it prevented damage to the liver.

I originally said thousands of babies had died from the approval delay. I can’t find evidence to support that claim, and all I can say with confidence is that it was probably at least a few dozen.

I originally said that the FDA delayed the approval process ~20 years. This is only true if dated from the first use of the oil in the United States, but nobody had seriously suggested the FDA approve it at that time. Dating from the first concerted effort by activists to make the FDA aware that there was a strong case for approving the drug, it delayed ~5 years. Some of this delay was not their fault, insofar as a company had not filed the relevant application.

My original presentation didn’t sufficiently discuss exculpatory factors for the FDA, including that they funded studies of the fish oil, and were helpful enough that the main doctor involved was left with a good impression of them.

Despite this, I stuck to my original assessment that the FDA’s delay in approving this drug was outrageous and an argument for reforming the medical approval system. Some people, including journalist/blogger

Kevin Drum

, thought that I was updating insufficiently by correcting minor details by continuing to assert this, and that the real story showed the FDA was fine. I

wrote a post disagreeing

, saying that although the FDA followed the procedures correctly, and the procedures made sense according to the values of the people who made them, the whole way the whole system works is fundamentally flawed. Many people, including some commenters I trust, continue to think I made more of a mistake here than I’m admitting, and I continue to disagree.

(4/25/21) In

my review of Global Economic History: A Very Short Introduction

, I judged the book harshly for saying that Italy had a higher GDP than Britain, when the opposite was true. A commenter pointed out that Italy had had a higher GDP than Britain in 2011, when the book was published. They were right and I was wrong.

In my

post on grading Trump predictions

, I judged Section 5, Prediction 1, on hate crimes to be true. A commenter pointed out that I had mistakenly used the numbers for “single bias incident” hate crimes only; taking all crimes together, it was false. I judged Section 5, Prediction 6, on race relations, to be true. A commenter pointed out that there was no data for one of the relevant years and I had to interpolate it as being halfway between the previous and subsequent year, and made a case for why this was shady. Based on that, I rejudged it to indeterminate.

(2/28/21) In my February 23

coronavirus predictions post

, I asserted that the US had the highest unofficial coronavirus death toll so far. Commenters made a good case that India’s was actually much higher,

see here for details

. I now think India probably had the highest unofficial death toll and it was a mistake to assert otherwise.

(3/29/20) In my March 27

Coronalinks

thread, I said confidently that quitting smoking would lower your risk  of mortality from coronavirus infections. Several readers then alerted  me to

research

saying that it might raise the risk. Although the research is tentative  and a little sketchy, it was a mistake to be so confident in the  original thread.

32.

(3/29/20) In my March 2

Coronalinks

thread, I speculated that the CDC was intentionally downplaying the  effectiveness of face masks in order to prevent people from hoarding  them. Although I still think the CDC underestimated the effectiveness of  face masks, my claim that it was intentional was wrong. They have had  the same policy consistently for years. See section 7

Adderall Risks: Much More Than You Wanted To Know

(written 2017) I stated that although Adderall might increase risk of  Parkinson’s Disease, Ritalin didn’t. Since then I’ve been informed of  several studies showing Ritalin probably does this too (see eg

here

).  I’m not sure what went wrong and I can’t retrace my steps to find what  made me think Ritalin was safe before; I think it was personal  communication with some people who I thought would have known. In any  case, don’t switch to Ritalin because you’re worried about Parkinson’s;  it won’t help.

Promising The Moon

(written 2014), I argued that technological progress had not slowed  from 1970 to the present (compared to its pre-1970 speed). Since then,  research by a bunch of people (summarized very well

here

by Tyler Cowen) finds strong evidence that it has. Despite its confidence and snark, my 2014 post was wrong.

Age Gaps And Birth Order Effects

, I found that birth order effects stop mattering suddenly after a seven year gap between siblings. A Less Wrong user tried to

replicate

and

reanalyze

the results, and found a less sudden decrease around seven years. They  concluded that birth order effects likely decreased more gradually after  “4 – 8” years. I agree their reanalysis is better and have edited my  post to link to it.

(8/21/19) In

It’s Bayes All The Way Up

, I suggested that psychedelics might work by strengthening the brain’s top-down priors. A more recent

paper by Carhart-Harris and Friston

provides compelling evidence that psychedelics probably work by

weakening

the brain’s top-down priors, meaning I got this one maximally wrong. This probably suggests a few other related posts, like

Mysticism and Pattern-Matching

, have serious flaws or are looking at things in unproductive ways.

27.

(4/24/19) A key piece of evidence in

Why Were Early Psychedelicists So Weird?

was a study finding psychedelics caused a permanent increase in openness. A more recent study

failed to replicate this finding

. I’m not sure how much to discount the post based on this.

26.

(3/28/19) I

reported on

a survey I did that showed people’s intuitive moral valuation of  animals matched their number of cortical neurons spookily well. A  commenter replicated the survey with a larger sample and got different  results. I

partially retracted

the post on the survey based on these concerns, but then we found a way to sort of reconcile the two studies, so I

updated the partial retraction

. It’s complicated.

25.

(11/20/18) My post

The Economic Perspective On Moral Standards

started with a discussion of the phrase “there is no ethical  consumption under late capitalism”. Some people brought up that this  phrase may usually be used in a way opposite to the way I was describing  it. See the comments for discussion, but given the potential error I  excised it from the post.

(9/7/18) In my

review of Thomas Piketty

(8/28/18) In

Elegy For John McCain

, I tried to write a poem that

balanced

my various conflicting feelings about him, including as a high-minded  and noble person, a martial hero who refused to tolerate evil, and  somebody who when you got down to the consequentialist brass tacks of it  spent a big part of his life promoting war and death in a disastrous  way. I apparently failed terribly at this and everyone thought it was  just attacking McCain in a way that was cruel to do in a period of  mourning after his death. I don’t want to claim this is just them being  wrong, because I think the poem does have an element of that and I  misjudged its appropriateness at least as much as I misjudged other  people’s reaction, and because enough smart people interpreted the poem  that way that I probably have to accept that’s the way the poem is. I  also should hold myself to higher standards since I’ve come out as  against this kind of thing before.

22.

(6/16/18) In

HPPD And The Specter Of Permanent Side Effects

,  I focused on cell death as the likely explanation for occasional  permanent side effects from psychedelics. Some commenters brought up an  alternate model based on

aberrant learning

.  Although the specifics don’t make a lot of sense, this would present a  better explanation for occasional LSD flashbacks and for  seemingly-similar conditions like

mal de debarquement

. It was a mistake of emphasis to focus on cell death rather than on this possibility.

21.

(4/12/2018) The post

Why DC’s Low Graduation Rates

found that DC has very low graduation rates relative to their test  scores (relative to other cities and states) and concluded that the most  likely explanation was DC had stricter standards. This was framed as  other states and school districts likely had borderline-fraudulent  practices of passing students who hadn’t learned very much. Although  there’s independent evidence for this and it definitely happens to some  degree, based on some of the evidence in

Highlights From The Comments On DC Graduation Rates

it looks like another major (more important?) factor is DC’s strict  policies on student absences, and possible screwy incentives that make  student absences difficult to avoid. If this is true, focusing so much  on standards was a mistake of emphasis.

20.

(4/10/2018) Despite some efforts otherwise,

my post on adult neurogenesis

came off sounding like it was settled science that it didn’t happen. A few days later,

this study

came out, providing some more evidence for the “it does happen” side. See also “

this comment

.  Although the subject is still in doubt, and although there’s still a  really interesting contrast between the certainty with which people  discuss the intricacies of neurogenesis and the uncertainty about  whether it happens at all, it would have been more accurate to frame the  post in these terms instead of as “it definitely doesn’t happen”.

Right Is The New Left

,  I predicted that liberalism was becoming so mainstream and busybodyish  that rebellious young people would start leaning right just to avoid it.  Although some young people joined the alt-right, I wish I had also predicted the degree to which rebellious young people would also move to a  democratic socialist Bernie-Sanders-esque position that attacks mainstream liberals for being sellouts and shills and morons.

18.

(12/17/2017) In my posts about

tax policy

,  I misunderstood the rates at which growth to the economy compounds; as a  result, economy-expanding policies look better compared to  direct-redistribution policies than I’d originally calculated. I still  think the existing tax bill probably doesn’t expand the economy that  much. There were a few other errors mentioned in the same post.

(11/19/2017) In

Depression Is Not A Proxy For Social Dysfunction

, I cited results that happier states had higher suicide rates. A more recent study using a finer level of analysis

is not able to replicate those results

.  This strengthens the case that the European results are just an  artifact of more vs. less industrialized, strengthens a possible case  that western states and high-altitude states are correlated and western  states have higher happiness while high-altitude states have more  suicide, and weakens a case that high altitude directly causes higher  suicide rates. Overall it weakens a case that happiness and suicide are  correlated in a meaningful way.

Book Review: Age of Em

,  I said we could calculate where hardware would be in fifty years by  assuming Moore’s Law held. But Moore’s Law doesn’t seem to be holding  anymore, or at least is on the verge of not holding, and that  calculation would have been very wrong.

Mental Disorders As Networks

,  I tentatively endorsed a theory that there may not be a single  underlying cause to all the symptoms of psychiatric disorders, but that  instead they might all cause each other by spreading activation through a  symptom network. While I still think there might be some element of  that, learning more about

predictive coding

has made me think that psychiatric disorders might come from imbalances  in various really-high-level features of the kind of processing the  brain does, like “too much bottom-up compared to top-down processing” or  “overly high confidence in neural predictions”. See

Towards A Predictive Theory Of Depression

for an example. This would explain the previously inexplicable tendency  of psychiatric disorders to be caused by practically anything but still  have the same symptoms, and it would mean that network theory was at  least mostly a dead end.

(9/24/17) In

Hungarian Education III

,  I mention that it’s implausible that the same family could give birth  to three geniuses – regardless of the IQ of the parents –  due to  regression to the mean. Several commenters pointed out this is true only  if the parents had high IQ for non-genetic reasons. If the parents had  high IQ for genetic reasons, and performed neither better nor worse than  their genes, then regression to the mean would not be expected and the  family could give birth to three geniuses.

Change Minds Or Drive Turnout

,  I repeated the claim that turnout was down 2% between 2012 and 2016,  and tried to determine what that meant for political strategy. In fact,  this was based on early numbers before all ballots were in, and turnout  probably rose during that time. Some of my analysis in Part III of the  post is invalid or obsolete, though it probably doesn’t affect the  overall conclusion.

G.K Chesterton On AI Risk

was an April Fools’ joke and not meant seriously. But it did criticize  Maciej Ceglowski’s piece where he accused singularitarians of not  caring  enough about the poor. The fake Chesterton of the piece said  that if  Ceglowski himself gave to charity at the same level as the  people he was  criticizing, he would “eat his hat”. Ceglowski pointed  out that he does  indeed give a lot of money to charity, including a  $15,000 donation  last year. Under the circumstances, I felt honor-bound  to eat my hat and

Some Groups Of People Who May Not 100% Deserve Our Eternal Scorn

,   I said that I thought Vox was mostly behaving responsibly, insofar as   everyone knows its biases, and looking beyond them it has good articles   on a variety of subjects. Several commenters argued that they had an   irresponsible tendency to publish informal “meta-analyses” of the   arguments for and against a specific position, while exaggerating the   arguments on their side and leaving out the best arguments on the other.   They said the “review of evidence” format has an implicit claim to   objectivity that can’t be sidestepped just by saying “everyone knows   their biases”, and gave some examples of this being used really   egregiously. After some thought, I agree. I continue to personally   respect many of the people at Vox and enjoy their articles, but saying   that they “may not 100% deserve our eternal scorn” was probably going   too far.

Contra NYT On Economists On Education

,  I said that an NYT article was so deceptive that it constituted  journalistic malpractice. Some people commented that they interpreted  the article in a different, non-deceptive way. Although

I still think

most people would interpret the article incorrectly, I think it’s  sufficiently possible to interpret it as intended that it was probably  just an honest disagreement in interpretations and not a deliberate  attempt to mislead. I deleted the “journalistic malpractice” phrase  after about an hour, and I apologize to the Times and to the author for  imputing motive. I still think they dropped the ball, though.

In Vegetarianism For Meat-Eaters

,  part 2 suggested that donating to animal welfare charities could save 3  – 11 animal lives per dollar. Based on critiques like those in

this essay

,  I now think those numbers are heavily exaggerated, maybe by several  orders of magnitude. I don’t know what the right numbers are or whether  the point is still somewhat valid.

8.

(12/1/16) I mentioned a few times (eg

here

)  a theory that increased carbon dioxide in poorly-ventilated areas might  hurt cognition, especially in the context of global warming which we  expect to cause increased carbon dioxide everywhere. Commenters pointed  out that submarines had carbon dioxide levels double or triple those of  anywhere else studied, but submariners seem pretty with-it and don’t  show noticeable cognitive declines. My guess (75% confidence) is now  that there’s no cognitive penalty for carbon dioxide within the levels  humans encounter in normal situations, but this could change if I see  more good studies on it.

College And Critical Thinking

,   I claimed that a graph showed a u-shaped relationship between time   spent in college and critical thinking, which suggested that the   relationship between the two was too confusing and unpredictable to be   very strong. In fact, commenter PSJ

pointed out

that this was only true of a small sample of two-year college  students,  and that most college students showed the expected linear  relationship.  Discovering the mistake strengthened my conclusion (that  college  probably does improve critical thinking skills at least in the  short  term).

Growth Mindset 3: A Pox On Growth Your Houses

,  I claimed that a graph showed that most conditions of an educational  experiment deteriorated over time, and that since this was very strange  the study probably couldn’t be trusted. In fact, the graph was  standardized in a way I didn’t notice, and showed only that those  conditions did worse than the other conditions, without deteriorating  outright. This made the study much more believable than I had thought.  The author of the original study corrected me and I explained the  correction in detail

here

.  Discovering the mistake lessened my confidence in my conclusion (growth  mindset isn’t very impressive and often fails outright) without  entirely reversing it.

,  I pointed out a paradox – how come women are joining the workforce, but  GDP has not gone up proportionally to the increased number of workers?  Pseudoerasmus

explained

that men were working less often and working fewer hours in a way that  counterbalanced increased female employment. Discovering the mistake did  not affect any “conclusion” since I was just asking the question, but  the question turned out to be much easier and less weird than I had  expected.

The Anti-Reactionary FAQ

points out

that medical care has improved since that time, so that many things  that would have been murders in the past are now only attempted murders,  lowering the apparent murder rate by as much as five times. Discovering  the mistake caused me to reverse my conclusion that crime has not been  increasing since the Victorian age.",https://astralcodexten.substack.com

the New Yorker here

, or the

Laine

,

Bear

, and

Trammell/Dwarkesh

articles that inspired it.

The “permanent underclass” meme isn’t being spread by poor people - who are already part of the underclass, and generally not worrying too much about its permanence. It’s preying on neurotic well-off people in Silicon Valley, who fret about how they’re just

bourgeois

well-off rather than

future oligarch

well-off, and that only the true oligarchs will have a good time after the Singularity.

Between the vast ocean of total annihilation and the vast continent of infinite post-scarcity, there is, I admit, a tiny shoreline of possibilities that end in oligarch capture. Even if you end up there, you’ll be fine. Dario Amodei has taken the Giving What We Can Pledge (

#43 here

) to give 10% of his wealth to the less fortunate; your worst-case scenario is owning a terraformed moon in one of his galaxies. Now you can stop worrying about the permanent underclass and focus on more important things.

On that tiny shoreline of possible worlds, the ones where the next few years are your last chance to become rich, they’re also your last chance to make a mark on the world (proof: if you could change the world, you could find a way to make people pay you to do it, or to not do it, then become rich). And what a chance! The last few years of the human era will be wild. They’ll be like classical Greece and Rome: a sudden opening up of new possibilities, where the first people to take them will be remembered for millennia to come. What a waste of the privilege of living in Classical Athens to try to become the richest olive merchant or whatever. Even in Roman times, trying to become Crassus would be, well, crass.

In 2014, I wrote

In The Future Everyone Will Be Famous To Fifteen People

. The argument was: suppose humanity ends up occupying millions of galaxies. People will still remember Earth as a special time. The mountainous mass of future historians will press down upon a tiny speck of current people. There’s no reason the colony ships won’t contain flash-drives of the whole 2026-era Internet, so, rather than being limited to a few prominent figures, these historians can study the generation around the Singularity almost in its entirely.

In such a situation, greatness is pathetically easy. A random woman gave Jesus a washcloth to wipe his face on the way to his crucifixion. She is now known as St. Veronica, patroness of laundry workers, and one out of every 2,500 girls in America is named in her honor. She has an annual feast day, approximately one million beautiful Renaissance paintings, a chapel in Jerusalem, and lesser churches all around the world (including one here in San Francisco). The richest olive merchant in Jerusalem that year is long forgotten, but she endures.

St. Veronica isn’t unusual in her charity: any one of us might lend a rag to a person in need. She’s special because she happened to commit her random act of kindness at the crucial - fine, pun

sort of

intended - moment of religious history, when a tiny speck of recorded happenings must support trillions of person-years of later adoration. If you worry about the “permanent underclass” meme, then you already believe we’re not

not

at another crucial moment. I’m not asking you to give up your dreams of owning a bigger moon than everyone else in order to chase a tiny chance of becoming the future’s equivalent of Jesus. I’m suggesting you give them up in order to offer the future a washcloth, and see if it honors your memory.

You have only X years to escape being permanently boring when the weight of galactic humanity descends to scrutinize your life forever. Ten million years from now, do you want transhuman intelligences on a Niven Ring somewhere in Dario Amodei’s supercluster to briefly focus their deific gaze on your legacy and think “Yeah, he spent the whole hinge of history making B2B SAAS products because he was afraid of ‘joining the permanent underclass’, now he has a moon 20% bigger than the rest of us?” Or do you want them to think “She was one of the heroes who arose when the fate of humanity balanced on a knife’s edge, fought against the thousand forms of entropy that could have ended our paradise before it began, helped create a vision of broad-based prosperity that benefitted all humanity, and gets 0.000038501% of the credit for our current happy state. We grant her the rank of Forebear, and the Ancestor Veneration And Simulation Collective has built a megacathedral to her memory three star systems over”?

I’m not trying to push you in any direction, honest. If you get everything totally wrong, too bad, but you’ll still be remembered forever for trying. Even Pontius Pilate has immortality of a sort. Both Eliezer Yudkowsky and Beff Jezos have their page in the textbooks assured. If you’re a well-off Silicon Valley person, you’re already well-placed to join them. So participate in the discourse. Create some art. Donate to a cause you believe in. Make a prediction. Discover something interesting.

Have more fun than anyone has ever had before - after all, history remembers Aristippus! Start a cool group house - after all, history remembers Epicurus! Be extremely hot - history remembers Antinous too! Sell people the lowest-quality copper that has ever been sold, and live forever as a meme six thousand years later!

Hi, I’m X a constituent in Y. I’m calling about reports that the administration is allowing U.S. firms to sell advanced AI chips, like Nvidia’s H200, to approved customers in China.

I’m very concerned this could strengthen China’s strategic AI capabilities. Access to high-end chips is what limits how fast powerful AI models can be trained. Easing these controls risks accelerating China’s progress in military and intelligence applications, eroding the U.S. and allied lead in critical technologies.

I’m asking the Senator/Representative to push for full transparency on these export licenses, strict enforcement of end-use checks, and public hearings on whether these sales truly serve U.S. interests, and to support the GAIN AI Act.

A bio policy group asks me to signal-boost their request for a volunteer to help them with vaccine policy research:

News reports indicate

that Secretary Kennedy plans to replace the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with Denmark’s, the developed country that recommends the fewest vaccines. This would reduce American children’s access to rotavirus, meningitis, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, RSV, and chickenpox vaccines. We are looking for researchers to help

Stanley Plotkin

(professor emeritus and co-inventor of the rubella vaccine) this week with a

publication

that aims to estimate the medical consequences if American doctors stop prescribing these vaccines. This would involve about 4-10 hours of work. If you are interested,

AI safety org MIRI is running a

“technical governance team research fellowship”

in early 2026. Technical governance is at the intersection of engineering and regulation, and includes things like designing chips with cryptographic off switches, or analyzing US and international law to see what levers different groups have to monitor AI training. The fellowship lasts 8 weeks (exact dates tbd but flexible), pays a $1200/week stipend, and will start with a one-week intro in Berkeley (flights/accommodations provided) followed by seven weeks potentially remote. No visa sponsorship. See here for more info or to apply.

Hating Boomers is the new cool thing. Amazon offerings include

A Generation Of Sociopaths: How The Baby Boomers Betrayed America

,

the two apparently unrelated books

How The Boomers Took Their Children’s Future

and

How The Boomers Stole Millennials’ Future

, and

Boomers: The Men And Women Who Promised Freedom But Delivered Disaster

. “You don’t hate Boomers enough”

has become a popular Twitter catchphrase.

Richard Hanania, who has tried hating every group once, has decided that hating Boomers

is his favorite

.

Some people might say we just experienced a historic upwelling of identity politics, that it was pretty terrible for everyone involved, and that perhaps we need a new us-vs-them conflict like we need a punch to the face. This, the Boomer-haters will tell you, would be a mistaken generalization.

This time

, we have finally discovered a form of identity politics which carves reality at its joints, truly separating the good and bad people.

I think these arguments fall short. Even if they didn’t, the usual bias against identity politics should make us think twice about pursuing them too zealously.

II.

Why, exactly, are Boomers so bad?

Zooming out, it seems sort of like Boomers have delivered the greatest period of peace and prosperity in history: global, American, take your pick. The window of Boomer dominance, c. 1980 - 2010, saw the fall of Communism, steadily rising incomes, steadily growing life expectancy, and no foreign wars bigger than Iraq (total American death toll: 4,500).

The Boomers could reasonably blame their Greatest Generation fathers for sending them to die in Vietnam. Those Greatest Generation fathers could reasonably blame

their

fathers for plunging the country into a Great Depression. In comparison, we’re mad about - what, exactly? Higher housing prices? Hardly seems World-War-level bad.

Earlier this month, we investigated

the Vibecession

: the economists’ claim that, despite everyone thinking the economy is bad, actually, the economy is good. We reached no firm conclusion, but in the process, we dug up

this chart

:

…which shows that Millennials and Generation Z have more money (adjusted for inflation ie cost-of-living, and compared at the same age) than their Boomer parents, to about the same degree that the Boomers exceeded their own parents. This is good and how it should be. The Boomers have successfully passed on a better life to their children.

The liberals make fun of Schrodinger’s Immigrant, who is both a lazy welfare parasite and also stealing your job. But equally sinister is Schrodinger’s Boomer, who destroyed America through being simultaneously too far right and too far left.  Progressives accuse Boomers of instituting market-worshipping

neoliberalism

, failing the challenge of

climate change,

and resisting the arc of history on issues like trans rights and Palestine. But conservatives accuse the same Boomers of

overregulating

everything in the name of “the environment”, shutting down the nuclear plants, and starting the trend towards “gay race communism” with their hippy-dippy 60s values.

In reality, the difference between generations on any of these things is barely noticeable.

I don’t think the Boomer-Millennial difference in most political opinions is big enough to matter much either way.

III.

There’s a more developed theory of Boomer-hating. The more developed theory goes: Boomers are plundering the young. We know this, because their share of resources is high and keeps increasing. They use their large population share and good voter turnout to vote themselves ever-higher pensions at the expense of working taxpayers.

How might we investigate this theory? We can’t use total social security spending, because the number of elderly has gone up. Can we use social security spending per elderly person? No; the amount of social security paid out depends on the amount paid in. If each year’s retirees earned more during their career than the previous year’s did (this is true), then each year’s will get a higher SSI payment, even if the system’s “generosity” stays the same.

We might start by looking at change in social security payment divided by change in median income. Over the past fifty years, average Social Security payment in inflation-adjusted dollars

increased 60%

. If we expect these payments to reflect earnings twenty years before disbursement, we can look at real median personal income from 1953 to 2003; this also

also increased 60%

. There is no increase in generosity.

Or we can just look at the history. The Social Security Administration’s

own website

says that its generosity peaked in 1972, when the program primarily served the Greatest Generation; since then, it’s been one contraction after another. In 1983, the government increased the full retirement age from 65 to 67; in 1993, they made Social Security more taxable. Since then, most of the changes have been cost-of-living increases, which are indexed to inflation and not the result of active lobbying on old people’s behalf.

Why do so many believe that old people have discovered a vote-themselves-infinite-benefits hack? Since old people represent an increasing fraction of the population, are living longer, and face a secular trend of rising healthcare costs, even when their benefits per capita per year are stable or declining the government will spend more money on them as a group. This spending is indeed rapidly becoming unsustainable, the elderly will need to accept big benefit cuts to make it sustainable again, and they are resisting those cuts.

So have we finally discovered the fabled Boomer selfishness? Call it what you want. But remember that the Boomers did pay money into Social Security to support their own parents, believing that they would be supported in turn. Learning that yours is the generation where the pyramid collapses is a hard pill to swallow. Maybe they should suck it up and take the sacrifice. You’d do this, right? Voluntarily give up money which is yours by right, in order to help other generations? Oh, sorry, you didn’t hear the question, you were too busy writing your 500th “You don’t hate Boomers enough, why won’t they hurry up and die, we need to declare intergenerational warfare and seize our rightful inheritance” post.

IV.

Maybe I’m wrong about all of this. There are different ways to analyze the data. For example, Medicare Part D is a genuine expansion of healthcare to the old - albeit one passed at a time when it benefited Silent Generationers instead of Boomers. I counted it under “healthcare is getting more expensive so we need more healthcare programs”, but maybe I shouldn’t have. Maybe it’s greed. And what about Europe? I hear the pension situation is even worse there, maybe the Boomers there are greedy, and I’m missing it due to my Americocentrism.

If that’s so, my question becomes: do we really want to do this again?

Consider

the campaign against property taxes

, another purported example of Boomer malevolence (I couldn’t find polling on this, so I didn’t include it above). If the polls come in, and they prove that it’s disproportionately supported by Boomers, does this prove their greed and selfishness? After all, Boomers own most of the property, so shifting the tax burden elsewhere directly benefits them.

I’ll answer this question with a question: suppose that the polls show that support is concentrated among white people. This is very likely true; white people are

usually

the biggest tax cut proponents. And we know white people on average own more property than black people, and therefore stand to benefit more. Does this make the tax cuts a form of race warfare? A perpetuation of white supremacy? An example of greedy white people trying to keep minorities down for their own selfish gain? You sure can find one billion people talking about how tax cuts are racially biased or opposed to equity or something (

It’s no devastating rebuttal to declare oneself tired of something. Still, I’m tired of this. After a decade of this discussion, I think many people are ready to stop thinking of every policy in terms of

who-whom

, and ready to discuss other facets like whether it overall increases or decreases net welfare, or how it manages the tradeoff between individual freedom and the public good. I think the decade we spent turning everything into identity politics resulted in worse policy than we got back when we were more reluctant to do that. Everyone knows that some groups are richer than others, that the rich groups are more likely to oppose redistribution, and that the poor groups more often support it. You can reframe this as a story of whites vs. blacks, or Boomers vs. Millennials, or the educated elite vs. the working class, or the abled vs. the disabled, or Jews vs. Gentiles, or any of a thousand other dichotomies that all correlate with wealth and with one another. Is this valuable? Does it dry a single human tear? I haven’t noticed.

But it gets worse. Consider the way that “capitalism” gets used in socialist spaces. Although there are still a few classical Marxists with a clear conception of what capitalism is and why they hate it, most lefties just use “capitalism” to mean

*gestures around expansively at everything*

, with no concern about whether it involves market processes at all. Israel bombing Palestine? That’s capitalism. Trump arresting immigrants? Somehow that’s capitalism too. It’s true that our society is very capitalist, and that capitalism touches

in some way

upon almost everything. But that gets laundered into an excuse to believe you’re being a good communist by hating everything about everything.

In the same way, 60% of Americans are white. The white fraction of the most powerful Americans, and among the forebears who got us into this position, is even higher. Say that you hate everything, and you sound like a nihilist who is hard to take seriously. But say that you hate “white people”, or “white culture”, or “whiteness”, and this is broad enough to give you an excuse to hate every specific thing, without having to admit you are doing this.

This is my true objection to the term “Boomer”. By this point, every institution in the world is either run by Boomers, used to be run by Boomers, or was shaped by Boomers in some way. It’s a cheap way of hating everything.

One might argue that at least anti-Boomerism has a time limit; at some point they’ll be gone and people will have to blame something else. Still, this is a double-edged sword. You shouldn’t be racist or sexist. But if you have to be one or the other, be racist. You can be racist purely and honestly, but if you’re hetero, then sexism will inevitably make you miserable: it can’t help but be a love-hate relationship. Yet ageism is even worse: you are doomed to one day become what you hate. You may never be a Boomer. But you will be in the position, vis-a-vis the younger generation, that the Boomers are in now. Hopelessly uncool, increasingly distant from the engines of memetogenesis, sitting upon assets that you are not at this moment using for market labor or family formation and which could easily be redistributed to others. Is it too hard to believe that the decisions you make now about stereotypes and identities and the level of respect due to elders will stick around a few decades?

What will our children think of Millennials and Zoomers? Might they get mad about wokeness and the pillaging of the American education system for temporary political cred? What about Trump, DOGE, and the decline of federal state capacity? Any of these seems worse than whatever happened in the Boomers’ heyday. The US has a way of bouncing back; maybe it’ll happen again. Still, the Boomers can boast that they passed on a better life to their children. How sure are you that you’ll be able to say the same?

I think a fair analysis by some sort of unbiased far-future historian might well conclude that Boomers were a perfectly normal American generation, maybe a little too fond of cringe Minion memes but otherwise decent enough; on the other hand, Millennials and Zoomers were some sort of mutant nightmare people. I hope my grandkids, if I have them, will love me anyway. Nobody ever controls that; nobody can ever know for sure. But I think respecting Boomers would be a good start.",https://astralcodexten.substack.com
https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-pledge,The Pledge,Content warning: attempting to guilt you into donating money,2026-01-04T04:11:05.594183,Scott Alexander,"This holiday season, you’ll see many charity fundraisers. I’ve already mentioned three, and I have another lined up for next week’s open thread. Many great organizations ask me to signal-boost them, I’m happy to comply, and I’m delighted when any of you donate.

Still, I used to hate this sort of thing. I’d be reading a blog I liked, then - wham, “please donate to save the starving children”. Now I either have to donate to starving children, or feel bad that I didn’t. And if I do donate, how much? Obviously no amount would fully reflect the seriousness of the problem. When I was a poor college student, I usually gave $10, because it was a nice round number; when I had more money, I usually gave $50, for the same reason. But then the next week, a different blog would advertise “please donate to save the starving children with cancer”, and I’d feel like a shmuck for wasting my donation on non-cancerous starving children. Do I donate another $10, bringing my total up to the non-round number of $20? If I had a spare $20 for altruistic purposes, why hadn’t I donated that the first time? It was all so unpleasant, and no matter what I did, I would feel all three of stingy

and

gullible

and

irrational.

This is why I was so excited ten-odd years ago when I discovered the

Giving What We Can Pledge

. It’s a commitment to give a certain percent of your income (originally 10%, but now there’s also

a 1-10% “trial” pledge

) to the most effective charity you know. If you can’t figure out which charity is most effective, you can just donate to

Against Malaria Foundation

, like all the other indecisive people.

It’s not that 10% is obviously the correct number in some deep sense. The people who picked it, picked it because it was big enough to matter, but not so big that nobody would do it. But having been picked, it’s become a Schelling point. Take it, and you’re one of the 10,000 people who’s made this impressive commitment. If someone asks why you’re not giving more, you can say “That would dilute the value of the Schelling point we’ve all agreed on and make it harder for other people to cooperate with us”.

The specific numbers and charities matter less than the way the pledge makes you think about your values and then yoke your behavior to them. In theory we’re supposed to do this all the time. Another holiday institution, New Year’s Resolutions, also centers around considering your values and yoking your behavior. But they famously don’t work: most people don’t have the willpower to go to the gym three times a week, or to volunteer at their local animal shelter on Sundays, or whatever else they decide on. That’s why GWWC Pledge is so powerful. No willpower involved. Just go to your online banking portal, click click click, and you’re done. Over my life, I don’t know if I would say I’ve ever really changed my character or willpower or overall goodness/badness balance by more than a few percent. But I changed the amount I donated by a factor of ~ten, forever, with one very good decision.

Unless you’re a genius or a saint, your money is the strongest tool you have to change the world. 10% of an ordinary First World income donated to AMF saves dozens of lives over a career; even if you’re a policeman or firefighter, you’ll have trouble matching that through non-financial means. Unless you’re Charlie Kirk or Heather Cox Richardson, no amount of your political activism or voting - let alone arguing on the Internet - will match the effect of donating to a politician or a cause you care about. And no amount of carpooling and eating vegan

will help the climate

as much as donating to carbon capture charities.

Not an effective altruist? Think it’s better to contribute to your local community, school, theater, or church? I’ll argue with you later - but for now, my advice is the same.  Have you thought really hard about how you should be contributing to your local community, school, theater, or church? (The fundraising letters my family used to get from our synagogue left little doubt about what form of contribution they preferred). Have you pledged some specific amount? You won’t give beyond the $10-when-you-see-a-blog-fundraiser level unless you take a real pledge, registered by someone besides yourself - trust me, I’ve tested this. The GWWC website is mostly pitched at EAs. But if you like churches so much, you can probably get the same effect by pledging to God -

and He keeps His own list, and offers His own member perks

.

To the degree that you care about changing the world beyond yourself and your family, in any direction, then the odds are good that this one decision - whether or not to take a binding charitable Pledge - matters more than every other decision you’ll ever make combined. Maybe an order of magnitude more. It’s something you can do right now, in five minutes. You shouldn’t do it in five minutes; you should sit down and think about it hard and talk it over with your loved ones and make sure you’re really planning to keep whatever pledge you make. But you could. And then every time you saw a charity fundraiser on a blog, you could think “Oh, sorry, I’m already living my life in accordance with my altruistic values, no thanks!” You wouldn’t even have to worry about how much to donate. I don’t even donate to half the fundraisers that I signal-boost!

So if you have time this holiday season, and you’re financially secure enough that it won’t be a burden, think about whether there’s some way you want the world to be different and better, whether there are charities that work on it, and whether you want to donate. Then, take

the pledge

.

If you decide you want to do something but it’s too stressful to figure out what, take

a 3% trial pledge here

, give it to Against Malaria Foundation, and come back next year to see if you’re ready for the 10% version.

UPDATE:

Bentham’s Bulldog also thinks you should take the pledge -

Fox Chapel Research:

I Think Substrate Is A $1 Billion Fraud

(and notes for

Part 2

). For years, Taiwan’s TSMC has been the only company capable of producing the most advanced AI chips; since Taiwan is a geopolitical flashpoint, this is a constant threat to US tech ambitions. Last month, a new startup called Substrate announced it had developed technology that would let it manufacture 100% Made In America chips every bit the equal of TSMC’s. If true, this would be revolutionary. But Fox Chapel finds worrying signs, like that the company’s founder “is a known con artist involved in such other things as [claiming to have solved] nuclear fusion and stealing $2.5M in a Kickstarter scam” or that “the company’s job postings are nonsensical and AI-generated.” This is enough for me; the question now becomes how so many people were taken in - the company got $150 million from investors led by Peter Thiel, was endorsed by the Trump administration, and received positive portrayals in Semianalysis, NYT, and The Free Press. I don’t understand business, and I know that sometimes you can hyperstition a technology into existence by betting sufficiently hard on a charismatic young founder and eliding the difference between “this is already real” and “this might become real if we all believe hard enough”, but this is a new and worrying level of hopium. Interested to hear from anyone who either believes in Substrate or thinks they understand how so many people fell for it.

Most Irish Foreign Aid Never Leaves The Country

. The statistics say that several European countries (including Ireland and the UK) give very generous foreign aid. But this is misleading: accounting conventions let countries count money spent on supporting asylum seekers in the donor country as “foreign aid”, even though the money never leaves the country’s borders. This is dangerous, because it makes it easy for countries to fund their asylum programs by cutting actual foreign aid: since they’re the same line-item on the budget, they won’t officially fail whatever foreign aid pledges they’ve made, and it’s hard for voters to notice. Ireland has so far resisted the temptation to do this, but Britain has succumbed to it.

St. Carlo Acutis

(1991 - 2006) is the unofficial patron saint of the Internet and “first millennial saint”. He’s best known for creating websites about Catholicism. If you think this sounds nice but maybe short of beatific, you’re in good company; his sainthood is something of a mystery, with Wikipedia saying that “even those with a deep devotion to him struggle to pinpoint his specific actions that led to his canonisation”, and an Economist article admitting that “nothing in his sparse life story explains that this ordinary-seeming teenage boy is about to become the first great saint of the 21st century”. Also “In that same interview, Acutis’s childhood best friend claimed he did not remember Acutis as a ‘very pious boy’, nor did he even know that Carlo was religious.” I’m fine with this; God speaks to each generation in their own tongue, and it is only proper that the first Millennial saint be a random person who hyperstitioned himself into sainthood with a viral website.

: it’s inconvenient to be constantly switching GPUs from one model to another, so if there isn’t enough model-specific demand to keep the GPUs running at all times, then the company loses money.

Everyone knows AGI could be bad for labor, but

Philosophy Bear argues it won’t be great for capitalists either

. The modern role of “capitalist” combines two things: performing high-status jobs like CEO and VC, and being a person who happens to have lots of money and sips cocktails on a yacht as passive investment income rolls in. From a socialist point of view, the first role provides cover for the second; if people ask “the rich” to justify their wealth, they can argue that they perform socially useful CEO and VC jobs, or at least inherited their money from somebody who did. But after AIs can do CEO and VC jobs better than humans, the capitalists will lose their excuse - and this at exactly the time that they’re becoming richer than ever (because AGI will drive up the rate of return on investment) and everyone else is becoming poorer than ever (because AI has taken their jobs). Bear argues that the only stable equilibria are either some kind of socialism/redistribution, or the capitalists pulling an AI-assisted coup to maintain their advantage.

Blueprint Polls

: according to voters, what would the perfect Democratic candidate look like? Here are the results for Democrats only (ie potential primary voters):

Note that the issues are “issue focus”, so it’s not a contradiction that Democrats are against both “advocating for Israel” and “advocating for Palestinians” - they just don’t want candidates who make either position on the Middle East a major focus of their campaign.

And here are results for independents, ie the people Democrats will have to convince in the general:

Yes, voters react positively both to candidates “over the age of 50”

and

candidates “under the age of 50”. Just don’t run 50 year olds!

I

previously blogged about

how embryo-selection company Nucleus appeared scammy. Sichuan_Mala looks deeper and

agrees they seems scammy

. Besides what I found, she finds several errors in the white paper, apparently fake customer reviews, and an accusation of IP theft from competitor Genomic Prediction. She also accuses them of plagiarizing competitor Herasight’s work, although it’s a bit subtle and I don’t know enough about field norms to know whether this is a case of flattery-by-imitation or totally out of bounds. A Nucleus researcher

responds to the scientific allegations here

, saying that the “plagiarism” was just convergent methodologies. And Nucleus CEO Kian Sadeghi

goes on the TBPN podcast here

to rebut the business allegations, saying that the customer reviews are real although some photos were changed for privacy reasons. There’s an appearance/facedox by fellow Nucleus skeptic Cremieux Recueil, although Kian declines to debate him directly; you can see Cremieux’s postmortem of the episode

here

. My opinion is that as potential customers, you are under no obligation to care whether the company plagiarizes papers or fakes reviews, but you should care about whether their genetic tests are good, and I continue to think they’re not. Their old competitor Genomic Prediction is cheaper, and their new competitor Herasight has more powerful predictors, so you’re excused from having to have an opinion on this, and should just use someone else’s product.

Pre-emption is when Congress blocks states from making legislation on a topic, saying it will decide all the laws itself. The states have signaled willingness to regulate AI pretty hard, so Big Tech has been pushing for AI pre-emption to (in their opinion) prevent an overly complicated patchwork of regulations, or (in their opponents’ opinion) shift everything to a Republican Congress that will drop the ball on regulation entirely. After their first attempt in June was defeated by a coalition of anti-tech liberals and anti-tech conservatives, we discussed (

But they hate AI so much that they need to believe every negative thing about it at the same time, and one of those negative things is that it’s just a scam and will never work, and this naturally pushes against being concerned about x-risk. But as AI improves, will the “just a scam” position become less tenable, shunting the associated psychic energy into other reasons to hate AI (including x-risk concerns)?

He thinks it makes him a better reasoner / statistics blogger / effective altruist to be able to “get a statistically valid view of the situation, not overindex on the happenstance of your life.” For what it’s worth, I’ll give my contrary data point - I think of myself as a reasoner / statistics blogger / effective altruist in a pretty similar vein as Matt, but AFAICT my visual imagination is totally normal; if other people are having their emotions yanked around by vivid images, that’s a skill issue.

. If you’re wondering what happened to him, you can read his 2024

Post-Mortem Of Neoreaction

here, where he discusses how he fell out of love with the movement (warning: he has not fallen out of love with racial slurs).

As a former fascist sympathizer, I can see why [fascism is on the downswing]. The allure of fascism in 2024 is much, much diminished. For a few reasons. A big one was COVID. See, the point of fascism is that Collective Action is necessary to have nice things. We need a strong government committed to the good of the people. Yarvin showed his preference early when he started his new Substack by quoting Cicero’s phrase “Salus populi suprema lex”. The health of the people is the most important law. Cicero wasn’t a fascist of course, nor is Yarvin really; a big point of fascism is to narrowly define the populus as an ethnic group with demonstrable ties to blood. That makes the government’s ties to the people stronger, increasing their commitment to do Good Collective Action. Which is important. Very important. A lot of good things can come of intelligently done Collective Action. Fascist Italy made the trains run on time. Nazi Germany fixed the terrible Weimar economy. East Asian countries are all effectively fascist states, if with less ideological baggage (yellows just aren’t like that), and they are all nice, clean, safe places with healthy economies. Fascism is not a panacea but it works, when you let it. Strong government can be pretty neat.

So why is strong government less appealing these days? Well, COVID happened. And our governments were pretty damn strong in dealing with it. They made strong laws and enforced them. And what did they do with their power? Absolutely retarded shit. They destroyed the world economy and made 95% of people completely miserable for 18 months. Up to 3 long years in some places. Again, as an Orient enjoyer I was very sympathetic of strong effective government. My life has been pretty cozy thanks to it for the past decades. But after seeing boomers, hypochondriacs, and menopausal women take the reins and use it against healthy people, I’m fucking done with strong effective government. Fuck that shit, I’m out. I don’t want to see strong effective government ever again. I was very lucky that I was out of China in November 2019. It was a fluke really. I moved to the Golden Triangle after that and the law of the jungle was much, much nicer during the Doctors Plague of 2020-2022. But I spent a few months in Europe during the time and man, that was brutal. Not just seeing how retarded governments were; the level of compliance by the people was so disheartening. Imagine being a sincere fascist and seeing your people behave like that. These are my people? My Volk? Am I supposed to sacrifice life and limb for the salus of this populus? Fuck that. Let them cook, they deserve everything that’s coming to them [...]

Is there a way to make the body healthy again? I do think so. I think there’s still place for a successor right wing ideology which is neither Christian fundamentalism or robot worship. And it will happen; but it won’t happen on Twitter. Maybe it can happen on Urbit, or right here in this site. I have some ideas myself, and I invite you to join me and build this together.

It would be funny if the solution to the paradox Jain highlights was that for every time a COVID lockdown turned a liberal into a conservative, it turned one fascist into a moderate, for a net rightward shift of zero.

The death toll of the ongoing Sudan genocide has risen to about 150,000.

Nicholas Kristof writes

that the world has once again failed to prevent atrocities, and argues that the most important point of leverage is pressure on the United Arab Emirates, which is arming the genociders. Sam Kriss also writes about the situation in

The World’s First Matcha Labubu Genocide

, but is unimpressed with Kristof’s take:

Sudan is passed over in a deeply uncomfortable silence. The absolute most you can do is blame the Emiratis. From what I’ve seen, more people seem to be appalled at the UAE for its frankly marginal role in arming the RSF than at the RSF itself. This is the approved way of understanding any inscrutably indigenous foreign conflict: you just worm out any third-party involvement and then act like you’ve solved the whole thing.

I side with Kristof here, for reasons that Sam himself touches on later in his piece, in a section comparing Darfur with Gaza.

It would be very easy to make people care about Darfur again. All it would take is a loud, vocal contingent of RSF apologists in the Western media.

I agree, but would frame it less cynically: the reason Westerners pay attention to Gaza is that there’s a lever to push: not only does America support Israel, but many of their friends support Israel, so they can imagine convincing America or at least their friends to stop, and at least feel like there is some remote chance of making a small difference (

and in fact, Trump getting mad at Israel and deciding to pressure them was decisive in effecting the cease-fire

). On the other hand, we don’t have many levers to affect ethnic Baggara in the Rapid Support Forces of Sudan, so it doesn’t really feel useful to write blog posts arguing that they should stop;

obviously

they should stop, nobody disagrees with this, and it goes without saying - so nobody says it. But the US does support the UAE, and many of our friends like the UAE or at least go there on vacation, so maybe it’s possible to have make some small difference by embarrassing them. 4D chess  take is that Sam Kriss agrees with all of this, but “loudly” and “vocally” argued against it to give people like me a hook to write about this genocide with, in which case I thank him for his sacrifice. It would also be nice to be able to donate, but I don’t know who to trust in the region - other than

That existing AI is a big deal (“at least as big a deal as the Internet”) but will not in and of itself be “abnormal”, ie revolutionary outside the distribution of past technologies.

That strong AGI

would

be revolutionary outside this distribution.

That “diffusion of AI into the economy is generally good”, both because it will have direct benefits and “also help us learn more about AI, its strengths and weaknesses, its opportunities and risks”.

That governments should be trying to track and understand AI better, and that “transparency, auditing, and reporting are beneficial”.

I sometimes do work for AIFP, but I wasn’t involved in this particular effort. Still, I agree with everything they say - except point 7, “AIs must not make important decisions or control critical systems”. Every time you take a Waymo, you’re letting an AI control a critical system; every time it chooses to stop at a red light but not a green one, it’s making an “important decision” (if you don’t think this decision is important, consider the consequences of failure). This isn’t a gotcha: it’s fine for near-term AI systems to make important decisions in cases where they’ve been well-tested and there’s good reason to think that they outperform humans on net. Getting rid of the last 0.001% of hallucinations and inexplicable behavior would be nice, but shouldn’t delay rollout if there are compensatory advantages. [EDIT:

First things first: the stunningly audacious raid that extracted Nicolás Maduro and his wife from Venezuela is a genuinely history-making victory for Donald Trump. At a cost of zero American lives, the United States captured a singularly destructive force: a dictator whose record of criminality and misrule blighted millions of Venezuelan lives and destabilized politics in the entire Western hemisphere.

After clumsily stealing an election he had plainly lost by a landslide eighteen months ago, Nicolás Maduro kept running the Venezuelan state as a sprawling criminal syndicate. Along with his powerbroker wife, Cilia Flores, he belongs in a prison cell as surely as anyone I can think of. Which is why you’ll be hard pressed to find a Venezuelan who doesn’t, on some level, rejoice at last night’s news.

In the weeks leading up to this history-making raid, I more than once rolled my eyes at reports that the United States might be planning an extraction operation to effectively kidnap a sitting president. The idea seemed just fantastical and theatrical, not to say harebrained. Well, they did it, and anyone who tells you they’re not at least a little bit impressed

Venezuelans today are waking up to an unrecognizable country. Like every dictatorship, Maduro’s had invested heavily in the myth of its own invincibility. And yet the regime is very much still in place, albeit in a weird, decapitated state. State TV is still running regime propaganda, Vice President (soon, one surmises, to shed the “vice”) Delcy Rodríguez is

still fulminating

on behalf of the Venezuelan government, the hardline interior minister Diosdado Cabello is still giving

fire-breathing speeches

condemning American aggression, Maduro’s notoriously repressive attorney general, Tarek William Saab, is still out

mining the night’s events

for propaganda points. The entire ghastly apparatus of state repression that Hugo Chávez built and Nicolás Maduro perfected appears, for now, to be fully in control of the country.

Maduro is gone. It’s tempting to think that, without him, the regime will implode. But Maduro’s was never the kind of personalist system that depends on a single leader. It was always more of a team effort, with a constellation of influential figures like Rodríguez and Cabello teaming up with Cuban intelligence to keep dissent at bay. In other words, the kind of regime that could very well survive decapitation. And if it does, Venezuelans will get the worst of it.

For three decades, the most trustworthy principle for interpreting Venezuelan affairs has been a simple heuristic: whatever outcome makes Venezuelans’ lives most miserable is always to be treated as the odds-on-favorite. If, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio

apparently told

successor ratcheting up state repression to rebuild the regime’s now tattered aura of invincibility.

Maduro’s abduction could easily become an all-purpose excuse to crack down on any and every sign of dissent: any expression of dissatisfaction will surely be used as evidence of connivance with the American enemy. Trump’s stunning one-day win could be remembered for heralding an even darker stage in Venezuela’s path towards totalitarianism.

Trump Wants to Dominate Venezuela, Not Liberate It

At the same time, as the post-9/11 era showed, if the United States did attempt to install a democratic government, that too could go wrong in a million ways. This is not to mention the fact that the operation was carried out illegally, with no Congressional authorization, and that the precedent of superpowers deciding which foreign leaders to capture may not always lead to the downfall of people as evil as Maduro.

All through this latest round of American pressure, the specter of half-measures has loomed large over Venezuela’s future. The Bolivarian regime is always at its most vicious when it feels most threatened, and, right now, it must feel enormously threatened. Time and again, when the regime feels threatened, it’s ordinary Venezuelans who pay the price.

Donald Trump and Marco Rubio will take a victory lap today. They deserve it. They’ve struck an enormous blow against a genuinely evil regime. But they’ve not overthrown it.

Chavismo

is very much still in control of Venezuela. Bloodied, weakened, humiliated, yes, but still in control, and newly motivated to exert even more state terror in a bid to stay in power.

Venezuelans all around the world are celebrating the fall of a vicious tyrant. But if the regime manages to ride out this storm, we won’t be celebrating for long.

Iran is once again experiencing a wave of

nationwide protests

. The Islamic Republic’s history of popular unrest dates back to the early 1990s, when rising economic inequality and growing public frustration triggered widespread demonstrations in rural and impoverished areas. The first major post-Revolution uprising occurred in 1999, following a government crackdown on students and intellectuals. The 2009 Green Movement marked a critical turning point. Millions took to the streets to protest alleged electoral fraud by former hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and to demand political reform.

A few years later, the 2017-2018 protests reflected deepening economic grievances across social classes, while the 2019 demonstrations, triggered by a sudden fuel price hike, evolved into one of the most extensive uprisings in the Islamic Republic’s history. The state responded with extreme violence, killing more than 1500 people in under a week.

Most recently, the

2022 protests

following the death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of the morality police ignited a powerful movement centered on women’s rights, political freedom, and resistance to systemic repression. Again, the regime brutally repressed this movement, killed hundreds of Iranian youths, and intentionally blinded hundreds by shooting them in the eyes.

The current protests, which began last Sunday, are following a similar trajectory. As in 2019, the trigger was economic grievance, which has led Iranian demonstrators to pour into the streets and demand the dismantling of the regime.

Yet despite their scale and intensity, all previous protests failed. What might the future hold for this current round?

To answer this question, one should examine the regime’s resilience in the face of repeated mass dissent. The key factor is the structure of the Iranian state itself. Over time, the Islamic Republic has transformed into a highly centralized and professionalized security state, capable of managing, containing, and suppressing dissent with remarkable efficiency. Its resilience is not accidental but the result of decades of institutional learning and strategic adaptation.

At the

center

of this system are the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Ministry of Intelligence, the Basij militia, militarized law enforcement, and a massive network of low-ranking security offices that exist in every corner of Iran’s bureaucracy. These institutions operate not only as coercive forces but also as deeply embedded actors within Iran’s political, economic, and social life. Their expansive reach allows the regime to monitor society closely and to neutralize dissent at an early stage. Surveillance, intimidation, and selective repression have become routine tools of governance.

These security institutions, originally established to uphold the political order and safeguard the regime, have become deeply integrated. They have transformed the Islamic Republic from a revolutionary theocracy into a modern security state.

Unlike the Pahlavi monarchy, which collapsed amid mass mobilization during the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the Islamic Republic has internalized the lessons of revolutionary vulnerability. It has invested heavily in intelligence capabilities, cyber monitoring, and psychological operations. The regime now anticipates unrest rather than merely reacting to it, using data-driven surveillance and preemptive repression to prevent protests from coalescing into a unified movement.

One of the most significant obstacles to political transformation in Iran is the fragmentation of the opposition. Over decades, the regime has systematically weakened alternative centers of power through repression, exile, and targeted assassinations. This strategy has left opposition movements divided, leaderless, and often ideologically fragmented.

A Letter From An Iranian

June 21, 2025

Read full story

Although protesters broadly demand political change, they remain divided over its nature. Some call for a secular republic; others advocate reforms within the existing system; and a growing segment supports a return to monarchy. This trend is visible in chants such as “Javid Shah,” “Reza Shah, may your soul be blessed,” and “This is the final battle, Pahlavi will return.” These slogans, heard in cities such as Arak, Rasht, and Khorramabad, reflect renewed symbolic support for the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, who has publicly

endorsed

the protest movement and urged unity, including appeals to the security forces to defect.

Yet this diversity of visions weakens collective action. The regime exploits these divisions through a deliberate strategy of divide and rule, ensuring that no single movement or figure can consolidate sufficient support. By controlling narratives and amplifying internal disagreements, the state prevents the emergence of a unified opposition capable of challenging its authority.

The resilience of Iran’s regime is also reinforced by its international partnerships. In recent years, Tehran has deepened strategic cooperation with authoritarian allies, most notably Russia and China. These relationships have strengthened Iran’s internal security capacity and reduced the effectiveness of external pressure.

Through long-term agreements like the 25-year partnership with China and cooperation with Russia from 2024 to 2025, Iran has gained access to digital authoritarian tools. These include deep packet inspection for internet shutdowns, AI facial recognition for social control, and advanced mobile tracking, enabling the move from reactive repression to predictive control. Russia has expanded as a supplier of anti-riot and electronic warfare systems, with cooperation agreements extending into the late 2020s. China’s “Safe City” infrastructure in Tehran and Isfahan has integrated high-resolution surveillance cameras with law enforcement databases, transforming cities’ ability to monitor unrest.

This international support network has significantly reduced the effectiveness of sanctions and external pressure, providing the regime with both technological resilience and strategic insulation.

The growing divide

between Iranian society and the ruling system is undeniable. Repeated waves of protest demonstrate a deep and persistent rejection of authoritarian governance. Yet the failure of these movements to produce meaningful change underscores the regime’s ability to adapt, repress, and endure.

As Iran enters 2026, the current unrest represents not a temporary eruption but part of a long struggle against an entrenched security state. While popular demands for dignity, freedom, and accountability continue to grow, the regime’s sophisticated coercive apparatus remains firmly in place.

Any meaningful transformation will require confronting this deeply embedded architecture. Without a strategy capable of neutralizing the state’s coercive power and overcoming opposition fragmentation, the prospect of democratic change remains distant. The struggle continues, but the balance of power still favors a regime that has perfected the art of survival.

Last year, things were easier because the electricity and gas infrastructure was not attacked to the same extent. This year, they really carried out intense shelling of the energy sector and gas hubs. Energy workers once needed hours for repairs—now they take days. Absolutely everyone is cut off.

We have special Telegram groups, “Ukrainian Power Grids,” with subgroups for each region. You receive an updated list and a schedule. In the evening when I go to bed, I check the schedule to understand what time I need to get up to get ready for work. You adjust your schedule if, for example, there will be no power from 6am to 11am. I’ll get up at 4am to get ready for work, dry my hair. But these schedules are often unpredictable, and I have to go to work with a wet head.

A difficult stage has begun, because it is winter and there is very little gas and electricity. The state can’t cope. This year, they didn’t even start the heating season on time. Usually the radiators in apartment buildings begin to warm up when the temperature drops below 59 degrees. The first sectors to be launched are kindergartens, hospitals, schools. We had a very cold summer and the fall was also very cold. By mid-October, the heating season would normally have been launched. It’s one thing when you walk along the street if the sun is shining on a 45-degree day. When you sit in an apartment, you just freeze.

The Everyday Abyss

June 24, 2025

Read full story

This fall, I lived for some time with acquaintances at their home, which they heated with a large fireplace. Other people used electric heaters and overloaded the system. Now people have huge generators, but there are crazy power surges and sometimes the generators catch fire. Our utility systems aren’t adapted to this. One house in Khmelnytskyi exploded because they were turning the gas on, turning it off, and something went wrong. Tragically, people died.

The company where I work ordered powerful generators from Europe. They told everyone that whoever has no light can come, can wash up, charge phones. They put in little sofas for people to lie down. If you go with a wet head, you take a hair dryer with you. Large businesses are very serious about providing for their staff. At stores you can sit down, take a break, get warm, heat up. They offer you warm tea. Businesses take care of Ukrainians and try, in difficult conditions, to create comfortable places where you can put your thoughts in order or answer calls.

But scammers are also very busy here. They steal money from card accounts overnight. I fell for a scam, so I decided to save money and travel on public transport. One day an air alert began and all transport stopped. When this happens you cannot move anywhere, you are simply dropped off, stand in huge lines, and you don’t know what to do. I just started crying. People are frozen in horror. You don’t know if a rocket is coming, you have nowhere to hide, there is no bomb shelter anywhere nearby. It’s cold outside, and you are trying to somehow think about what to do next and how to save yourself.

There have been

very heavy attacks on Kyiv with drones and missiles. You see these Shahed drones flying over apartments and killing families. You don’t know if you will be next or not. People have started going into bomb shelters more often.

During one attack, I got scared and ran out into the corridor of my building. They’d shot down many Shahed drones in the neighborhood, and there were fires. When I went back home it was dark, and in the morning I woke up because it was cold—some kind of wind was blowing through the apartment. I went into one of the rooms and saw the window had been blown out badly. The curtains were still hanging. It’s good that I wasn’t in there when it happened, because I would have been slashed by the fragments.

There used to be a repair program for things like that, but now there are so many victims that the program no longer works. We sealed up the window with plastic wrap, and it was like that for a while. During this time I lived at my aunt’s. It’s harder for me to get to work from her place. But compared to people who lose their entire homes, their apartments, mine was a slight scare. Our local TV channels interviewed one man who lives in the center of Kyiv. It often gets hit there. He has already changed his windows eight times. He says, “Every time I still change them in the hope that this will be the last time.”

No one can say this happens accidentally. They attack near hospitals, houses. You see for yourself that they are targeting the population. You can drive through Kyiv and see scorched apartments. You understand that there were people who died there. One morning, my Dad called from Zaporizhzhia and said, “I don’t remember it ever being like this, so many rockets flew over the house. I thought,

That’s it, this is the end.

”

Many people have started getting sick, especially after attacks. It is very strange that so many people just get knocked off their feet. It hits the throat, it hits hard. And I myself was sick recently with COVID. My voice disappeared. The worst thing is that Russia is now tactically hitting medicine warehouses, and because of this many people cannot get vital medicines. My colleague was asking for a medicine that only just became available at the pharmacy near my house. I arrived there, and the pharmacist told me that their warehouse was completely destroyed. Only today did a truck arrive from Germany with the drug. I bought four packs for my colleague.

And then there’s the political situation. One day we hear that Donald Trump has talked to Putin, that things are sort of getting better. Then we get bombed again, everything is smashed, people die. Then Trump says he’s disappointed with Putin. Every time he says something like, “

Putin disappointed me

,” my colleagues and I laugh. These are political games that are won and lost by casualties among the civilian population. And how many of our military have died? How many young guys, young girls? It’s a horror. And it’s difficult to speak about anything else, because, unfortunately, we are just pawns in this big game—nothing more.

on why the Democratic Party seems to have abandoned the working class. But I’ve long been fascinated by President Carter’s national security advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and now finally he has the biography he deserves.

Zbig: The Life of Zbigniew Brzezinski, America’s Great Power Prophet

by

Edward Luce

brilliantly captures Brzezinski’s originality as well as his coruscating wit. Brzezinski was a contemporary of Henry Kissinger, and like him was an emigrant to the United States. Together they were leading figures among that rising breed of scholar-politicians of the postwar period—“all knowing grand viziers to the sultans of their time.”

While conventional wisdom in the late sixties and seventies was that the United States was going to the dogs, Brzezinski predicted a new age of American dominance. He also rejected the popular convergence theory, believing instead, as President Reagan would, that U.S.-led capitalism would grind Soviet communism into the dirt. That kind of originality made Brzezinski useful to people like the Rockefellers and, most of all, to the rising Democrat Jimmy Carter, who appointed him national security advisor in 1977.

Brzezinski was often criticized as a cynical realist in the vein of Eisenhower’s secretary of state, John Foster Dulles. His typically blunt response was that “world politics is not a kindergarten.” Carter became increasingly offended by Zbig’s realism, preferring instead to stake out the moral highground.

My favorite part of my job is to read so many books—and to see if the authors live up to my expectations of them. So I greatly enjoyed

Helen Lewis

’

The Genius Myth

, which explores how our choice of who we place on a pedestal has changed over time, and what this tells us about our society.

Lewis argues that, since the Middle Ages, we’ve seen “genius” as being a special kind of person—a Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, a William Shakespeare, a Steve Jobs. We love our geniuses to have some sort of tragic or complex life, such as dying young, being addicted to something destructive, or having a love life that requires a diagram to understand. Jane Austen, for example, lived a disappointingly dull life, which has led to her being excluded from some compilations of geniuses.

Despite these challenges, we persist in hoping that geniuses can share their greatness with us. Lewis uses the example of the organization Mensa—the world’s largest high-IQ society—which initially thought it could poll its membership on leading issues of the day, so the world could gain from their insights. Unfortunately, outside their individual subjects of expertise, the Mensa members turned out to be just like everyone else.

This human desire to put someone on a pedestal cropped up again in my other favorite book this year,

Charlatans

. Traditionally, they argue, charlatans were pretty limited to either selling health products or “get rich quick” schemes. However, driven by the Internet, our near-universal screen addiction, and corresponding loneliness and social isolation, we now live in a “charlatanogenic” culture, with lots of opportunities to idolize and be scammed: the promise of love, the meaning of life, connecting with aliens, and much more.

Of course, one particular charlatan in our culture springs to mind, and Naím and Toro explore the impact of charlatans in politics too, arguing that the tactics Donald Trump used even before running for office (“the big, attention-getting promises with scant follow-up, the serial deception, and the obsession with money”) echo those of history’s biggest charlatans. A depressing observation, but a great read!

The book I’d like to feature is

Furious Minds

by

Laura K. Field

. This is a book that deals comprehensively with the intellectual origins of the MAGA right. I was particularly interested in interviewing Laura because of her background. She was trained as a Straussian—that is, by second and third generation students of Leo Strauss, the political theorist who wrote about the “crisis of modernity” and published dense commentaries on a host of philosophers including Maimonides, Hobbes, Machiavelli, Xenophon, and many others. I myself have a similar background, having been a student of two teachers Laura writes about, Allan Bloom at Cornell and Harvey Mansfield at Harvard.

What I wanted to learn from Laura was where a certain group of Straussians went wrong, such that they ended up becoming big supporters of Donald Trump. This group includes John Eastman, Michael Pack, and Michael Anton—the latter the author of the famous

“Flight 93” article

in

The Claremont Review of Books

, which claimed that the United States would continue in a terminal death spiral unless voters rolled the dice and voted for Trump in 2016.

December 4, 2025

Read full story

Many people are aware of the divide between so-called “East Coast” and “West Coast” Straussians, the latter associated with the Claremont Institute and Strauss’ student Harry Jaffa. Jaffa was the author of the excellent book

Crisis of the House Divided

on the 1858 debates between Abraham Lincoln and Senator Stephen Douglas. In that book, he argued that Stephen Douglas’ arguments for states’ rights and federalism in the U.S. Constitution were ultimately trumped by the Declaration of Independence’s assertion that “all men are created equal,” and that, contrary to Douglas, democratic majorities of white voters in the South could not legitimize slavery. Yet today, Claremonters are echoing Douglas in their calls for a return to the “original” Constitution, and downplaying the promise of equality in Jefferson’s Declaration.

Laura’s book goes way beyond the Straussian world, however, to cover other right-wing writers like

Curtis Yarvin

and Costin Alamariu (a.k.a. “Bronze Age Pervert”), who are much more Nietzschean. In my interview with her, she went out of her way to defend the general Straussian approach to teaching political philosophy, and expressed gratitude to her teachers for opening her eyes to the great Western philosophical tradition.

In this I very much agree with Laura. Like many second-generation students of Strauss, I benefited enormously from my classes with Bloom and Mansfield. I can easily recognize some of the blinkers that such an education induces (such as disdain for social science and empiricism more generally). But nonetheless I am grateful for having received a true liberal education. Laura’s book is an excellent introduction to that world, as well as an alarming account of what has happened to America in the age of Trump.

This year has been consumed by the radical antics of the Trump administration. As a result, I have spent more of my time than is probably healthy looking at the latest headlines. But that is also why I have particularly enjoyed the writing of podcast guests that have expanded my horizons: ones that inspired me to think about broader themes which will remain relevant long after depressing outrages—like Trump’s recent decision to add his name to the Kennedy Center—are (hopefully) long forgotten.

A lot of smart and educated people I talk to still worry that the world is headed toward a crisis of overpopulation. But as

Dean Spears

In most countries, a low fertility rate is the more pressing problem today—and while the world’s population will continue to rise for a few decades, it is likely to crash soon after. Spears and Geruso are hardly the first to make this point; but this is the best primer on this topic for a general audience I have found so far.

Peter Hessler

River Town

Other Rivers

, written when Hessler returned to the province to teach in Chengdu, that I found to be more touching: it chronicles the lives of his former students, and contrasts their fates with that of a younger generation growing up in a country that is vastly more affluent—but also, in important ways, less full of hope.

In this week’s conversation, Yascha Mounk and Ivan Krastev discuss international reactions to the Trump administration, Europe’s weaknesses, and the impact of changing demographics worldwide.

This transcript has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.

Yascha Mounk:

We’re recording this at the end of the year 2025. I thought about how to round off the year for myself and for the podcast. The obvious way to do that seemed to be having conversations with two people who have most helped me think about the world and given me orientation in very disorienting times. I’m having one conversation with our friend and colleague Francis Fukuyama, and another conversation with you, as a kind of year in review.

We could start in many places, but a natural place to start, in some ways, is the White House. You said on an earlier episode of the podcast this year that the Trump White House was a kind of revolutionary movement, and that part of a revolution is that it always self-radicalizes and that you don’t really know where you end up. It feels as though the Trump White House has been self-radicalizing, but perhaps in the last few months it has also been getting stuck. How should we think about what is going on at the heart of American power?

Ivan Krastev:

I’m sure you will know better, because one of the interesting things about revolutionary dynamics is that it’s better to be where the action is. This is very much about how you feel it and how people are reacting to it. What was important this year was the speed. If you go back, you have the feeling that in January you were transferred from a normal train to a fast train, and everything started happening very fast. But it was not very clear what the destination was.

What you’re sensing, in my view, when you say that it feels stuck, is that people are puzzled about where the train is going. Funnily enough, it was very fast and very radical, but what was the objective? That, in my view, is starting to paralyze Trump himself, because he was jumping from one small issue to another. The grand narrative was missing. There is no big story anymore that he’s telling.

From this point of view, even when you look at the national security strategy, it reads much more like a transcript of his mind than a story for the future. It’s more a story of what he has done than of what he is going to do. That, I believe, captures the broader sense.

The second point is that, interestingly enough, over this year a lot of things have happened, but neither the fears of people who believed this was the end of the world nor the hopes of his supporters came true. This is true of the economy. There were the tariffs. Many liberal economists said this is where inflation would break out, and it didn’t. His supporters said there would be tariffs and manufacturing jobs would come back, and that didn’t happen either.

So, strangely enough, a lot has happened, but nothing really changed at the level of how people perceive their lives. This is probably what people mean when they talk about peak Trump, the sense that the energy he came in with has been exhausted without it being very clear what the next thing is that he can do.

Mounk:

That’s interesting. Part of it is the speed. There are two things. The first is that so many things were happening at the beginning that it felt like the “move fast and break things” approach in the famous Silicon Valley parlance, and it felt like they were going somewhere. Now that we’ve had more time to take stock and assess what they were doing, it looks more like a toddler who can run around and break a lot of things very fast, but who is running in a circle with no particular direction.

The other thing is that it does feel as though the speed with which the administration is doing things has slowed down a little bit. Right now, and I’m very aware of the risk of being premature here, because we would have said one thing in March 2025, another thing in June 2025, and another thing now, and the story may still look very different in two or three years, it looks as though some of the restraints on government are holding better than it felt like in March or April 2025.

The Supreme Court may rule tariffs unconstitutional, at least in the way they were passed. That’s not certain, but it’s what many legal experts expect based on the oral arguments in that case. The administration has certainly played with slow-walking its response to adverse legal rulings. In some cases, it has deported people who were already on planes when judgments came down, in ways that were deliberately close to the line. But it hasn’t yet simply ignored a court ruling outright.

There’s now the prospect of Democrats winning back the House of Representatives in 2026 and being able to limit Trump’s power in other ways if they regain control of at least one chamber of Congress. Do you feel like the Trump revolution has slowed in those ways as well, or is that premature? What should we expect for the coming twelve months?

Krastev:

Many things, of course, can change, because this is also about how people react over time. But in my view, he exhausted a lot of the energy that came with him in petty fights. In a strange way, the most interesting story about the Trumpian revolution is that it has the energy and the anger, but no future project.

A large project could be totally utopian. You can like it or dislike it, but it allows you to have a story and to focus on the big things. Because of who he is, and because of the narcissistic nature of the leader, which became the narcissistic nature of the regime, what happened over this year is that he aged in front of our eyes. Revolutions do not like aging.

When he entered, because of the energy, he was an old young man. He was very energetic. He was doing this and doing that. Now the cameras are capturing him sleeping, not being there, and this is changing the perception of people, including those around him.

Last week, I was working with colleagues from the European Council on Foreign Relations on their global survey. It covers twenty-one countries, eleven in Europe, as well as China, Russia, Brazil, and South Africa. It’s interesting to compare the data with a year ago and see how the world has started to view him differently.

Because the data will be public on January 15, I don’t want to go into too much detail, but there are two striking things from this year when viewed from global public opinion rather than American public opinion. This was the year when everyone was talking about Trump. But when you look at the data now, there’s a widespread sense that the next ten years are going to be the Chinese decade.

We see this every year, but you may be surprised by how suddenly people have become convinced that China has the upper hand, and how the rise of China is no longer scaring people. That is the interesting story in the data.

Mounk:

Is that because views of America have become so negative that China looks like a relatively better alternative? Is it because views of China have become more positive? Is it that people have simply gotten used to the idea? What do you think has changed that perception?

Krastev:

Of course, America has lost ground in some parts of the globe. For example, South Africans have changed their views of the U.S. quite significantly. But something very important has changed.

During the Biden period, there was both fear and expectation of a return to bipolarity. The United States confronting China, a renewed great-power confrontation. When Trump came in, there was an inertia that assumed this was what would happen. The paradox of this one year is that Trump was extremely polarizing in domestic politics, but he was depolarizing in international politics.

This happened because tariffs hit everyone. He was making deals with the Chinese. He was making deals with the Russians. Suddenly, for many people, China became another name for multipolarity. That does not mean America is declining or going to be ousted, but China stopped looking as dangerous and aggressive.

Many international relations scholars believed the rise of China would push countries and publics toward the United States. Instead, you now see public opinion in places like India warming toward China, despite a long history of conflict. This is quite interesting, because there was so much focus on Trump that many people missed how these dynamics were changing.

Part of it is that China managed to stand up to him without appearing particularly aggressive, even though it was. Another part is that he disoriented everyone else. From a European perspective, when Trump came to power, leaders knew they would have a difficult time. They assumed that even if Trump was challenging, the U.S.-China confrontation was so central that Europe would remain necessary.

Instead, we ended up in a situation reflected even in the national security strategy, where every region is largely on its own. There is no overarching frame. This matters because so many things happened so quickly. The speed was enormous. But at the end of this year, there is more of a feeling of exhaustion than a sense of major achievement relative to the objectives the administration set for itself.

Mounk:

How do you think this is going to play out? I want to come back to the United States, but let’s stay with the question around China for a moment. It’s striking that over the course of the past year, attitudes seem to have become more accepting of China playing a major role going forward.

In part, that’s because for many parts of the world, China is going to pose an even bigger challenge. When you’re sitting in Europe and you see that the United States is now imposing significant tariffs on Chinese goods, that’s going to lead to even more competition from Chinese imports elsewhere. It’s going to become harder and harder for China to export, for example, car technology to the United States, and that creates a massive problem for the German car industry.

If you’re sitting in Berlin, Paris, or Vienna at the end of 2025, you might think the challenge from China is actually bigger than it was a year ago, not necessarily because China is doing anything particularly wrong, but because of these broader dynamics. Yet the perception seems to be moving in the opposite direction.

Is it that, for medium powers like Germany or France, the idea of a multipolar world is more appealing because it offers more room for maneuver? Do you think being less concerned about China is a rational response, or do you think it’s short-sighted and underestimates the nature of the challenges we’re now facing?

Krastev:

This mood, of course, can change. Any crisis can change it. But in a strange way, the decline of American power and the rise of China are perceived by many as a rebalancing. One thing that, in my view, Trump got wrong was focusing almost entirely on trade and the economy. There was an implicit sense of not talking about ideas and, to be honest, not talking much about war or other issues either.

Suddenly, he started competing with the Chinese on their own terrain, and that is a game you cannot win. Fifty percent of global manufacturing production now comes from China. China also managed to stand up to Trump without looking hysterical or aggressive. They pushed back and created a sense of predictability.

If you look at Europe, on one level it is clearly threatened by the Chinese shock you’re describing. There will be more and more cheap goods entering European markets. Macron said during his visit to Beijing that Europe has no option but to consider tariffs to protect its industries. But because Trump confronted Europe so directly, Europeans have become much more cautious than before. They are asking whether they can really afford an ideological confrontation with Washington, a military confrontation with Russia, and an economic war with China at the same time.

I don’t believe this response is limited to Europe, and I don’t think it’s unique to middle powers either. In my view, middle powers share three characteristics. First, they are very ambitious. In moments of disorder, they tend to see opportunities more than risks, partly because they are status-conscious. In a more disorderly world, there are more ways to assert status.

Second, room for maneuver is critical for middle powers. Being a middle power means hedging. In a world where America is loud and present but not disciplining, hedging becomes easier. It was much harder to hedge in a period of strong ideological confrontation, when you were expected to take sides and clearly define who you were.

Third, because Trump tried to engage personally in nearly every conflict and play a role everywhere, a new kind of middleman position has emerged. This goes beyond traditional middle powers. Some countries have become professional mediators. Look at Qatar, the Emirates, or Saudi Arabia. In a certain sense, there are now more mediators than disputes.

This position has been strengthened by two characteristics of Trump’s diplomacy. The first is his belief that, in order to solve a conflict, you should not know very much about it. I’m saying this, to be honest, with a certain level of sympathy. If you know too much, you know very clearly what cannot happen, and sometimes you need an outsider to break a status quo. From that point of view, there is probably some truth to the idea that, particularly if you want to disrupt an existing equilibrium rather than simply close a deal, an outsider can help.

The second point is that, because he operates through non-professional diplomats, personal friends, and businesspeople, the world has suddenly become very monarchic. When you look at relations between the great powers, almost with the exception of China, it can feel as though it’s not states negotiating but families. You see figures like Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner meeting Mr. Dmitriev, who is close to Putin’s family. In both cases, foreign ministries are reading the news to understand what was negotiated.

I believe this nineteenth-century flavor is critically important. The personalization of power, which in my view has been fueled by social media and its ability to amplify this anti-institutional dynamic, allows many things to happen. At the same time, you begin to lose clarity about what exactly has happened.

Mounk:

Where does that leave Europe? There’s been a lot of talk this year about Europe’s weakness. The phrase you used earlier, that Europe is in an ideological confrontation with the United States, a military or proximate military confrontation with Russia, and an economic confrontation with China, captures how embattled the continent is.

I tend to have a quite pessimistic view of both the current state of Europe and the extent to which European political and intellectual elites have understood the stakes of the moment. There’s an assumption in the European public, which I’ve seen in a number of opinion polls, that France twenty-five or fifty years from now, or Germany twenty-five or fifty years from now, will look more or less like today, just a little worse. I’m not convinced that future exists, or that it’s a realistic prospect for how things might go.

Subscribe

Perhaps I’m overstating the point. Perhaps being a middle power, or a collection of middle powers, depending on whether you think of Europe as a single entity or of Germany and France as separate countries, will offer significant opportunities in this new multipolar world. Perhaps Europe can maintain a military alliance with the United States while relying less on American predominance, and continue trading extensively with China, managing tariffs and other measures along the way.

It may be that ten or fifteen years of crisis, during which European industry has fallen behind, could allow Europe to discover new areas of economic strength where it can compete. How dire is Europe’s situation likely to be in this new, more monarchical, more multipolar, and perhaps more transactional world that you’re describing?

Krastev:

It has been said that Europe is the most vulnerable part of the world these days. Of course, this is also because it is the wealthiest. As a result, this combination of vulnerability and wealth, which means that everyone is trying to see what they can get out of you, is quite clear. If you look at opinion polls, and our polls show the same, Europeans themselves are the most doubtful about Europe.

This creates a situation in which the European project was really prepared for a different world, and that world has disappeared. On one side, you have Russia at war, and it was never a secret that Russia sees the very existence of the European Union as an obstacle to its foreign policy objectives in Europe. On the other side, you have an American president who is essentially saying the same thing. He is saying that what is not a nation-state does not have the legitimacy to exist.

If you are a European citizen or leader, this is deeply shocking, because Europe has gone through too many kinds of disintegration to know that the cost of unraveling is very high, particularly with an aging population and a stagnating economy. Normally, when you think about the future, you don’t know what is going to happen. Only Nostradamus knows that. But you usually know what is not going to happen. You have certain assumptions about what cannot happen.

At the core of the current crisis is the belief among Europeans that the United States, under Trump, could side with Russia over Europe on the Ukrainian crisis. That possibility is destroying many of the assumptions on which their world has been based.

Suddenly, there is a sense that many solid assumptions no longer hold. You can have crises in relationships, problems here and there, but not everywhere at once. From this point of view, the European Union is beginning, in many respects, to resemble the Habsburg Empire, which survived only insofar as it could convince others that its existence was in their interest. There is a growing feeling that this momentum is being lost.

At the same time, this opens an interesting question about what could happen next. For me, that makes 2026 particularly important. Because of President Trump and his highly ideological politics, one effect has been the encouragement of political parties in Europe that see their relationship with the Trump administration as a political strength.

The key question is what happens if Democrats win Congress. If that happens, Europe will face a very interesting choice. Trump-aligned forces in Europe implicitly hope that Trump will remain in power for a long time. Otherwise, they can expect that if European politics becomes defined by American domestic politics, a Democratic return would be very damaging for them.

This raises the possibility that even some far-right parties and mainstream parties could renegotiate a basic consensus on Europe. What should the European Union be? What should remain, for example, of the single economic space? What should change and what should not? From this point of view, the end of 2026 and the beginning of 2027 may be the most critical moment.

The strength of the Trumpian right in Europe is closely tied to Trump’s own strength. This is not because there are no domestic reasons for support of these parties, but because Trump’s existence allows them to act as European players rather than merely national ones. Many of these parties no longer dream of exiting the European Union. They want to change it. From this perspective, what seems clear is that the European Union is unlikely to survive in the institutional and ideological form in which it was originally created. The major renegotiations of the European Union will be shaped largely by relations with the United States on one side and Russia on the other.

Mounk:

One change during 2025 is that at the beginning of this year, you had a fresh Labour government that was already having a bad start but was still sufficiently new that it looked like it might get its problems under control. You had in France a political system that was under obvious strain, but there still seemed to be relatively good prospects of some kind of coherent, moderate candidate emerging for the presidential elections in 2027. You also had a fresh government in Germany with Friedrich Merz, or perhaps that came a few months into the year.

Now, at the end of this year, you have Nigel Farage’s Reform Party leading in the polls. In the Westminster system, you can get a big majority with 32 or 33 percent in a fragmented party system. By the same token, if you lose five or six percentage points, you can suddenly go from a projected majority of seats to being a minor player. But according to current polls, Nigel Farage would have a majority of his own in Westminster whenever the next elections come.

In France, you have Jordan Bardella leading opinion polls very clearly for the first round, where he would get about 33 percent of the vote, while the next candidate would get around 16 percent. He is also leading in matchups for the second round against virtually every competitor, relatively narrowly against some center and center-right candidates like Édouard Philippe, and very clearly against any candidate on the left.

In Germany, you have Alternative für Deutschland, the most radical of the right-wing populist parties in major European countries. It does not look like it is about to govern nationally, but it is either even with or ahead of the Christian Democrats in most national polls. It may, for the first time, enter government in some state parliaments in East Germany, and depending on how things go, it may even win an absolute majority in some of those state parliaments after elections due to take place in 2026.

One question raised by all of this concerns transatlantic relations. I’ve been saying repeatedly since Trump’s national security strategy was published that many European mainstream outlets want to frame this as an ideological battle between the United States and Europe. But I think it is an ideological battle within the United States and within Europe. The Democratic Party does not agree with the national security strategy. Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden’s national security advisor, who was on my podcast in February or March, does not agree with it. By the same token, many people in Europe, including spokespeople for parties that may be in government in London, Paris, and perhaps eventually Berlin in the coming years, do agree with it.

So one question is whether this becomes the new basis for transatlantic understanding. Are we facing a breakdown of the transatlantic relationship, or a shift of that relationship onto a very different ideological track?

The second question posed by those opinion polls in Britain, France, and Germany is where we are in what I think of as an epochal struggle over European populism. Are we losing across the board? Does this family of political parties continue to rise unabated? Should that temper any optimism we might draw from the fact that Democrats appear poised to retake the House of Representatives in 2026?

Krastev:

On one level, I don’t believe the Cold War or post–Cold War West can be restored. This type of relationship between Europe and the United States that was typical for the last thirty years cannot return, for a very simple reason. It was based on the fact that regardless of who came to power, these relations did not change dramatically.

Now, and I agree with you on this, the dynamics of the relationship between the United States and Europe are very much defined by domestic politics on both sides. On the right, you have an alternative project. Not the West as the free world, not the Cold War West, which was universalist and centered on relations between the United States and Europe, but the idea of the civilization of the West. This is very clearly reflected in the security strategy, where the West is framed as a kind of Christian civilization, a white civilization.

The question is how stable this project can be. Here there are several issues, including some ironies of history. If you look at why Trump’s America is so unhappy and furious with Europe, it is because Europe has become Americanized. The discussions about multiculturalism and being more open to migration are ideas normally associated with America, not Europe.

It is also ironic because the United States was founded as an alternative to the old Europe of nation-states, closed nation-states. It was the New World. Now, in a strange way, the Trump administration resembles a migrant who left Europe two hundred and fifty years ago, built a life elsewhere, no longer likes the place where it lives, looks back, and says, what happened to the country I came from? I want to go back, but it is no longer the same country.

I understand this story, but I don’t believe you can easily build a civilizational alliance on this basis. That alliance would require America to be ideologically present in Europe while reducing its military presence and financial commitments, while arguing that Europe should spend more on defense and be able to defend itself.

This brings us to the second part of the problem you’re touching on. We are likely to see a much more militarized Germany at the same time as a Germany in which the AfD could eventually enter government. How does that change Europe? The far-right parties we are talking about, to different degrees, are sympathetic to major elements of the Trump administration’s agenda, particularly on immigration and national culture.

At the same time, historically, they are in competition with one another. I don’t believe Marine Le Pen would be particularly happy to see a future in which Germany’s defense budget is three times larger than France’s. That is the interesting part of the story. One thing that also matters to me is that Trump is a nationalist, but he is a nationalist without history.

Mounk:

When Tucker Carlson interviewed Putin, the first hour was essentially a history lesson about all the ways Russia has been wronged and why it needs to regain its grandeur. It’s very hard to imagine Trump giving a one-hour history lesson with the same knowledge and conviction.

Krastev:

It’s not even about knowledge. He does not believe that history matters. In a certain way, what is interesting about Trump is that he is not interested in what happened before he was born, and honestly, he is not interested in what is going to happen after he leaves office. One moment that always stayed with me was when he was recounting a conversation with the Chinese president and said that she told him he would not invade Taiwan while he was in office.

From this point of view, you have an extremely important difference in time horizons. On one side, you have Putin, and you also have Xi, who think in terms of centuries. This is excessive, but it is real. The Russian president asks for ninth-century archives to be brought to him. He wants to see original documents. He meets archaeologists to understand where Russians come from. On the other side, you have the President of the United States saying that he is not thinking in terms of centuries, but in terms of weeks, because the world is moving so fast.

This creates a problem, because the nationalists on the European side share several characteristics. These parties are driven by deep demographic anxiety, by dramatically changing populations, and by the feeling that the country is no longer home, because home is a place you understand and believe you understand, and that feeling is gone.

At the same time, when you look at their projects, many voters for far-right parties are migrants themselves, but they want to migrate to the past. They are not dreaming of a different economic model. They are dreaming of a different demographic and ethnic composition of society, which is extremely difficult to achieve. It is particularly difficult because demographic change is so dramatic. This is what drives these parties, but it is also what paralyzes them.

One figure really struck me in the U.S. national security strategy. There is half a page devoted to Africa. In 1900, twenty-five percent of the world’s population lived in Europe, and between eight and nine percent lived in Africa. If United Nations projections are correct, by 2100, six percent of the world’s population will live in Europe, and forty percent will live in Africa.

You then end up with a security strategy that treats Africa as a footnote and tells Europeans to be who they used to be. That is not easy, because demographic decline, low fertility rates, and the failure of governments to address these issues are already realities. These societies have already been remade. Instead of trying to understand how they can be governed, what can be achieved and what cannot, there is this dream of returning to the past, and that is not going to work.

Paradoxically, if you look at American history, this logic does not work there either. Even the idea of “white,” which did not exist in Europe before the emergence of America, was an inclusive concept. “White” emerged because Bulgarians like me, Jews, Italians, and Irish were not considered white in the eyes of Germans or Englishmen.

Instead of focusing on how to redefine the world so that societies can function and be governed, we retreat into nostalgia. There is a difference between nationalism and nostalgia. The real drama of Europe is that there is national sentiment, but there are no longer national economies.

When we ask what is going to happen, imagine the European Union disintegrates and you are left with nation-states. What does the Bulgarian nation-state look like? What is the Bulgarian national economy? What kind of protectionism is possible at the level of the state? How does it compete with anyone?

There is a major contradiction between a world increasingly organized around large spaces and civilizational states, and a U.S. political offer that encourages fragmentation in Europe while proposing civilizational alliances. I find this deeply disturbing.

Mounk:

Let’s pick up for a moment on this idea of demographic anxieties that you’ve talked about a lot. There are two elements here. One is immigration. In the United States, the choices of the Biden administration that led to a large influx of migrants across the southern border were probably one of the reasons Donald Trump was able to win re-election in 2024. There was a very detailed article in

The New York Times

a few weeks ago that went deeply into some of the choices the Biden administration made and why it made them. Reading it, the whole thing felt like a bit of a train wreck.

In Europe, there are strong reasons to think that the expressed preference of the population for many decades to have more control over borders and less immigration, combined with the inability or unwillingness of policy elites to deliver on that preference, is one of the main reasons for the emergence of right-wing populist parties. In the study of populism, it used to feel like there were many new ideas emerging every year because it was such a fresh field. At this point, the number of genuinely new ideas seems to be diminishing, and much of the research is circling similar themes.

There was, however, a very good article published in 2025 by Laurenz Guenther on what he called a cultural representation gap. One of the things he showed very vividly was that in 2013, the average German voter’s view on immigration was to the right of the average member of parliament from the Christian Democrats, which at the time was the most right-wing party in the Bundestag. That meant there was a large gap between the views of the average voter and those of the most right-wing party in parliament. What happened next was that this space was filled by Alternative für Deutschland, and immigration remains the most potent recruiting ground for these parties, particularly in Europe.

As you’re saying, though, there’s a deeper question. One question is how to deal with border enforcement and how to avoid continually handing such a large electoral gift to populist parties. The deeper question is why populations around the world feel unable to reproduce themselves in the way that historically happened, through having children and raising the next generation of citizens within the country.

This is a deep problem across Europe, particularly in Southern and Central Europe, but throughout the continent. It’s now a major issue in the United States. It’s also a problem in India, where fertility rates have fallen below replacement level. It’s a significant issue in the Islamic Republic of Iran, where fertility is around 1.6 children per woman. It is a massive problem in East Asia. China is likely to be one of the dominant powers over the next ten or twenty years, but if it wants to remain dominant over fifty or one hundred years, it will have to address its severe depopulation challenges.

How is this going to play out? Are countries going to find ways to encourage citizens to have more children, or are we heading toward worldwide depopulation?

Krastev:

This is an incredibly important story, demography, because in my view it has several elements that are dramatically different from any other period before. Demographic fears have existed before. In the nineteenth century, there were strong demographic fears about overpopulation. That was Malthus. There would be too many people and not enough food and economic resources. For the first time in history, what we are facing is the fear of depopulation. This is new and it has three critical parts. The first is not simply that fertility rates are now very low. It is that we cannot understand why. They are low everywhere. They are low in rich countries and poor countries. They are low in autocracies like China and in democratic countries like those in Europe. Normally, one would expect fertility to stabilize around replacement level, about 2.1, based on theories of demographic transition, women’s education, and gender equality. But suddenly, even in countries with very generous social systems and highly egalitarian societies, like Finland, fertility rates are extremely low.

I am not even touching on South Korea, which looks almost suicidal in demographic terms. In places like Russia and Iran, all of this is blamed on a Western conspiracy. The narrative is that because liberals in the West do not have children, they do not want others to have children either, so they promote feminism and gay rights. Part of the anti-gay propaganda in many of these countries is explicitly about fertility rates. But the reality is that governments can spend a great deal of money trying to incentivize young couples to have children, and it does not work. In countries like Hungary, around five percent of GDP goes to policies aimed at reversing demographic decline, and the results are modest. You do not just have a demographic problem. You have a demographic problem without a solution. Governments do not know what to do.

The second element is that for a long time people believed technology would help. Artificial intelligence, automation, and robotics would compensate for labor shortages, especially in caring for aging populations. But technology has become a source of fear as well. We hope technology will solve demographic problems, but we also fear it, particularly artificial intelligence. People are not only afraid of being replaced by migrants from Africa, the only region with strong demographic growth. They are also afraid of being replaced by robots.

This fear is combined with another factor: the concentration of wealth and technological development has created the prospect of individual immortality. You may remember the famous conversation between Putin and Xi about people living to 150 years and organ replacement. This creates the idea that a small group may be able to buy immortality, while most people remain mortal. This is a new kind of inequality that feels impossible to bridge. It resembles ancient Greek mythology, with a few immortals determining the lives of mortals.

Previously, people accepted individual mortality because something larger would endure. One of those things was the nation. You would die, but your children would remain, and their children after them, along with a shared culture. Now there are no children. You face the mortality of the individual and the mortality of the nation.

The third element of demographic anxiety is political. The fear is not just that newcomers will take jobs, but that they will outvote you. There is also the fear that governments will select migrants based on how they are expected to vote. This obsession destabilizes the basic understanding of political community: who belongs, how belonging is defined, and what identity means.

I often use a simple example. There is an Italian restaurant in Vienna that was originally founded by Italian owners. It was later bought by someone else. Now the owner is not Italian. The waiters have never been to Italy, do not speak Italian, and do not know much about Italy. But the restaurant has Italian music and an Italian menu. Is this an Italian restaurant? For me, it is. For an Italian customer who expects to speak with someone from the same place, it may not be. This captures a deeper identity conflict.

This reflects a clash between two ideas of majority in democratic politics. One is the historical majority that formed the nation. The other is the electoral majority that emerges on election night, which can be ethnically very different. The first person to experience this clash may have been the first president of Poland in the 1920s. He was elected and survived only a short time before being assassinated. His killers argued that he was elected by minorities, Jews and Ukrainians, and therefore could not be the president of Poland.

This tension between migration, democracy, and the remaking of nations is critically important. Civilizational discourse does not help, because it only says “defend,” without offering solutions. At the same time, Trump captures some very real anxieties, particularly in Eastern Europe. For Eastern Europeans, ethnic homogeneity of the state was understood as a lesson of the twentieth century. People say populations have always moved in Europe, but the difference is that twentieth-century movement resulted in ethnically homogeneous states, especially in the East. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are examples. This homogeneity was produced through population transfers, the Holocaust, and the expulsion of Germans.

What we are now witnessing in Europe is the unmaking of these ethnically homogeneous states. This raises further questions. Are Bulgarians in Germany part of the problem Trump talks about? Or are migrants only those coming from outside Europe? Then comes the question of Islam. This is also striking, because in the imagination of the American far right, Russia is a white Christian nation. In reality, Russia has the largest Muslim population of any European country, and one of the strongest centers of political Islam is Chechnya.

We are living in a world where policies are increasingly driven by anxieties rather than ideologies or solution-oriented strategies.

“Well, then you need to shut it down.”

That was Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn’s

reaction

when a Google executive explained during a recent Senate hearing that large language models (LLMs) sometimes “hallucinate” and generate false information. The Tennessee senator was outraged that Google’s open-source model Gemma

had fabricated defamatory

stories about her and a conservative activist. The next day Google

disabled consumer access

to Gemma.

Blackburn’s demand captures a dangerous moment for AI and free expression. As generative AI is embedded into search engines, email, and word processors, it will mediate ever larger parts of the information ecosystem that people rely on. Governments are discovering that they can pressure companies to censor what may be the most consequential communications technology since the printing press.

Recent efforts go well beyond combating clearly illegal content such as child sexual abuse material. From Brussels to New Delhi, Warsaw to Washington, officials are wielding regulations, threats, and public shaming to shape what information, ideas, and perspectives billions of people can access through AI.

In October, the Dutch Data Protection Authority

warned

that AI chatbots made by OpenAI, xAI, and Mistral are “unreliable and clearly biased,” since they produced voter recommendations that tilted toward far-left and far-right parties ahead of national elections.

The regulator

argued

such behavior could violate the EU’s new AI Act, which requires powerful models to mitigate ill-defined “systemic risks,” including “negative effects on … society as a whole.” It referred the matter to the European Commission, which can impose fines of up to

7 percent

of global annual turnover for non-compliance.

In July 2025, Poland’s

government reported

xAI to the European Commission after X’s chatbot Grok generated antisemitic content and offensive comments about Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. A spokesperson for the Commission

told journalists

, “We are taking these potential issues very seriously … we are in touch with the national authorities and with X itself.”

Government crackdowns in authoritarian and illiberal states, meanwhile, provide a disturbing demonstration of the stakes involved. In July 2025, a Turkish

court partially banned

Grok for generating content “insulting” toward religion and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. When asked in February 2024 whether India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi was a fascist, Google’s Gemini cited experts who had characterized his policies as such, pointing to “Hindu nationalist ideology” and a “crackdown on dissent.” India’s Minister of State for IT

declared

that this response violated Indian laws. Google apologized and, until at least

December 2024

, Gemini responded “I can’t help with that right now” when asked about Modi and fascism. In other words, a prominent global tech company, whose products are relied upon by billions for reliable search results, filtered its most sophisticated technology to appease a government offended by content citing expert statements.

In the United States, and to a lesser degree other open democracies, legal protections for free speech will provide a buffer against overt state censorship of LLMs. But in many countries around the world, free speech exists only on paper. And even where it is legally protected, governments frequently engage in jawboning: informal pressure meant to push companies to restrict lawful speech without leaving fingerprints. Officials can hint at investigations, regulation, or licensing consequences if companies do not “cooperate.” In July, for example, Missouri’s attorney general Andrew Bailey

sent letters

to major AI companies threatening investigations under state deceptive advertising laws if they failed to provide data about alleged political biases in the outputs of their chatbots.

There are ways that the largest AI companies can disincentivize jawboning and mitigate the effects. Companies may not always be able to refuse government requests to censor outputs when faced with potentially ruinous fines, criminal sanctions for executives, or blanket bans. But through transparency they can make sure that their users know what their governments want to hide or manipulate.

Major AI developers should create a public, searchable database—a Jawboning Repository—where they disclose every government request to censor, filter, or modify their LLMs or chatbots—and how they responded. Requests should be logged by country, agency, legal justification, and category (e.g. “hate speech,” “national security,” “insulting the leader”).

This would build on existing efforts such as the

Lumen database

for internet takedown requests and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression’s

model legislation

requiring U.S. agencies to log contact with social media firms.

lets users track content restrictions on its platforms by national governments. But while tech companies do provide discrete transparency initiatives, none include government requests for AI censorship. Moreover, the initiatives that exist vary widely in methodology, detail, and user friendliness.

By creating a comprehensive Jawboning Repository covering the most popular LLMs, companies will significantly enhance the public’s insight into government attempts to censor AI models. This will force governments to defend their actions in the court of public opinion. Such transparency will deter the most egregious overreach—and preserve the promise of AI as a tool for expanding, rather than constraining, human knowledge and expression.

https://www.persuasion.community/p/francis-fukuyama-7,No Title,,2026-01-04T04:11:27.588182,Yascha Mounk,"Francis Fukuyama is the Olivier Nomellini Senior Fellow at Stanford University. His latest book is

Liberalism and Its Discontents

. He is also the author of the “

Frankly Fukuyama

” column, carried forward from

American Purpose

, at

Persuasion

.

In this week’s conversation, Yascha Mounk and Francis Fukuyama discuss why Donald Trump is flagging, whether American institutions are resilient enough to survive, and the future of Ukraine.

This transcript has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.

Yascha Mounk:

We’re recording this at the end of 2025. It truly has been an eventful year, an impactful year. It feels like it unfolded in two phases.

The first phase was Donald Trump assuming office, and turning out to be impressively efficient at and taking control of the reins of power, much more so than during his first term. For a few months, it felt as though the entire architecture of the American government was changing.

In the last months, it has felt as though that revolution has begun to slow in various ways. The title of the piece you published recently in

Persuasion

is

Don’t Panic, Trump Is Flagging

. Where do you think we are now, at the end of this year, in terms of the Trump administration and its ability to transform America?

Frank Fukuyama:

Well, Yascha, you’ve made that whole account in a morally neutral way. The question is whether he’s been transformative and effective rather than whether he’s been good or bad. I think the good-or-bad issue is probably the prior one.

To me, the surprising thing was actually how bad he became in his second term in office. I had written various things at the time of the election. Many centrist Republican friends of mine were saying he wasn’t so bad the first time around and that he would probably be good for the economy, and so on and so forth. I felt that this was not likely to happen, that he was going to be much worse the second time around.

Even I did not anticipate how much worse he would be. He has pursued a very explicit authoritarian agenda, trying to do everything through executive order, bypassing Congress, and trying to ignore the courts as much as possible.

He then engaged in a revenge tour. The Susie Wiles interview that appeared in

Vanity Fair

pointed to this. She thought she had an agreement that he would only pursue the revenge part of his agenda for 90 days, and he actually intensified it after that.

Mounk:

That is an extraordinary thing to say in the first place:

You have 90 days to take revenge and then we’ll get serious

.

Fukuyama:

He completely ignored that supposed agreement, and the revenge part of the term has really kicked in very powerfully. In terms of effectiveness, that is actually the one saving grace: a lot of the incompetence from the first term seems to have reappeared.

Part of it is that the things he wants to do simply cannot be done. You can’t invent a charge and get a grand jury to indict somebody who hasn’t done anything wrong. That is clearly the case with both Letitia James and James Comey. Only Donald Trump thinks they actually committed a crime, but they couldn’t get a legitimate prosecutor to make that case. When they did get an incompetent prosecutor to try, the grand jury rejected the charges, which is extraordinary, because grand juries in the United States almost never reject charges.

Mounk:

The famous line from a New York prosecutor in the 1980s was,

I could indict a ham sandwich if I so chose

.

Fukuyama:

That’s right. It turns out they couldn’t indict a ham sandwich. In fact, the felony indictment for the person who threw a ham sandwich at an ICE officer also failed to stick. You are retreating back into a comedy of errors of the sort seen in the first term, which I think is good for the cause of justice per se. It is also very revealing of the bad intentions now playing out.

I think people who follow the Justice Department are completely appalled by how Pam Bondi has succeeded in hollowing it out. The entire Civil Rights Division and a very large number of prosecutors and attorneys have either left the department or been forced out. Morale has plummeted because everyone can see what is happening, and they are not serious about law enforcement.

If we want to talk about what was unusual about this year, one major factor has to be the extraordinary level of political corruption this administration has engaged in. It begins with the pardons. Everyone expected him to pardon the January 6th defendants. He said he would not pardon those who committed serious violence, but that promise was abandoned almost immediately. He is effectively selling pardons. Any wealthy person who wants to get out of jail approaches him through an intermediary and walks free.

For an administration that claims to be waging a war on illegal drugs, why pardon the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of extremely serious drug charges? Those charges originated during the first Trump administration.

Mounk:

That was remarkable to me. There are pieces of corruption where you can see how it serves Trump’s financial interests. There are other pieces where it seems like he is building political alliances. That case, though, seemed to defy logic even beyond the usual level of outrageousness.

Fukuyama:

I suspect that, in time, we are going to learn why it happened. I suspect that there will be some personal element to it, where somebody in the Trump orbit is benefiting personally from his release, because that seems to be the way he is conducting many of these pardons and, frankly, foreign policy. India received a 50 percent tariff because Prime Minister Modi would not support his bid to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

It is really hard to describe what his foreign policy is, since much of it is dictated by his personal needs and his desire for personal glory rather than any concept of national interest.

This is why he has been crosswise with parts of his MAGA base. They expected him to be a consistent isolationist, and he has been anything but. These are all surprises that occurred over the course of 2025, and things that I think even the most pessimistic among us did not anticipate.

Mounk:

There’s a great, if depressing, tour d’horizon, and I agree with you that I had low expectations of a Trump administration, but they were significantly exceeded in how bad things have been. Before we get more into the substance of things, I’m struck by the fact that the Trump administration is proof that shamelessness really works in life.

The level of shamelessness around some of the corrupt behavior and some of the personality-cult elements is striking. There was a recent newsreel that really pales in comparison to many other things that have happened over the last twelve months, but it stood out to me. There used to be free entry to national parks on Juneteenth for the past few years and on Martin Luther King Day for much longer. Both of those were cut by the Trump administration, which is part of a broader cultural agenda that is perhaps unsurprising coming from the MAGA movement.

They then granted free entry to national parks on Donald Trump’s birthday. Who cares which days people have free entry to national parks? There are much worse things happening in the U.S. government. But Trump’s entire career has been proof, over and over again, that this form of shamelessness works.

You’ve thought a lot about human passions, the importance of thymos in politics, and the way some people like Donald Trump might be driven by megalomania, by an attempt not just to have self-respect but to dominate others. What explains the way we seem to forgive the shamelessness of people like Donald Trump?

Why does that behavior not lead us to rebel in the way we would if a friend or acquaintance behaved similarly in our daily lives? We would say we want to cut this person out of our lives. We’re sick of them. Yet when it appears on a larger political canvas, we forgive it.

That is what I find so interesting about Donald Trump. Many people who vote for him are good Americans who are polite and kind and would not tolerate a neighbor or acquaintance who behaved the way Donald Trump does. Yet they vote for him.

Some may vote for him grudgingly, thinking they share his political views but dislike his conduct. Others seem to enjoy, on the large political stage, what they would never tolerate in their personal lives. I’ve never quite been able to make sense of that.

Fukuyama:

I do think that a lot of this is facilitated by the internet. We now have this electronically mediated form of communication with other people that does not impose any barriers on the most base instincts people have.

If you think about it, when I was young, say in the 1960s, if you wanted to openly insult people on a large scale, how would you do it? You would go to a bar and yell at somebody, but that would be the limit of the reach of what you could say. Now you can speak to millions of people at the same time, and you are going to get more people engaged if you say something insulting or gross.

There has also been an element of fear that has induced many sensible Republicans to toe the line with respect to Trump, because he has this fanatical base that he can threaten people with. That will be interesting now, because I do perceive that there are cracks in that front. The moment people begin to lose their fear of Trump, the whole thing could come crashing down fairly quickly.

We have been waiting for this to happen for the last eight years, and it has not yet. But people are now realizing that he is only going to be around for at most another three years. They have to think about their future after Trump.

Mounk:

Is that a matter of Trump getting old, being term limited, or becoming unpopular? Is it a mix of those three things?

Fukuyama:

I think it is all three of those things. His health and his mental state are clearly deteriorating. He always rambled and said strange things, but it is getting worse. Yesterday or the day before, he posted on Truth Social around 160 times. Somebody compiled a list of those posts, and most of them are completely deranged. He is reposting the most bizarre conspiracy theories out there. I think of it as being a little bit like the emperor Caligula, who made his horse into a senator or consul. At a certain point, it goes to your head.

This is a general problem with presidents and presidential systems. The whole system is designed to feed the ego of whoever is president, because in a presidential administration, everyone around you wants something from you and fears you. Even a mild-mannered president like Jimmy Carter ended up acting in uncharacteristic ways because of the power the office gives you.

When you take somebody like Trump, who is already a narcissist and very self-preoccupied, and give him that kind of power, along with the narrative that he was persecuted and then proved everyone wrong by getting re-elected, you end up with a personality that believes it can do absolutely anything. That is the behavior we have been seeing. At a certain point, that fear is going to erode, and we are already seeing some signs of that.

Mounk:

If, in 2026, Democrats do take back the House of Representatives and perhaps have a strong showing in the Senate, that will accelerate that process. That is one of the big things to watch in the coming year.

If your thesis is that the administration is getting stuck at the moment, there are two ways of projecting that into the future. One is that it has run out of energy. It had a set of agenda points it wanted to put in place at the beginning. It had a theory about how to transform the United States. Through a mix of the limits of that program, incompetence, and some pushback from other branches of government, including the judiciary, which I think has been more consequential than some people have portrayed, it has gotten stuck.

The result could be a kind of flailing about for the next three years. The other way of thinking about it is that, as the administration realizes it is stuck, it becomes more desperate to get unstuck. Trump is clearly someone who is always hyperactive. He is not someone who fades quietly. There are presidents who get stuck in a second term, run out of time, look ahead to their presidential library, and accept that they are fading away. It is very hard to imagine that trajectory for Trump.

It is obviously good news if the administration is getting stuck. There is also a concern that this could lead to desperation, which could make the administration even more radical than it has been in its first year.

How do you think this dynamic is going to play out? We are recording a 2025 year in review. Trump took office on January 20, 2025. We are less than a quarter of the way through this term, with a little over three years left. I do not want you to be too cheerful at the end of the year, but how is this going to play out? What are they going to do to get the cart out of the mud?

Fukuyama:

One immediate fear is the coming midterm election in November 2026. By intention, Trump and his fellow Republicans would be perfectly happy to try to manipulate that election the way they tried in previous ones. It is going to be hard for them to do that because midterm elections are handled by states and municipalities, lower levels of government. The federal government, fortunately, does not have a major role in administering elections.

It will also be difficult if the polls are right about the size of the potential blue wave next November. It is one thing to manipulate an election that is off by two or three points, as in many previous elections. If the Democratic challenger is ahead by ten points, that becomes much harder. At that stage, you are stuck with the citizens’ choice.

If escalation were to happen beyond that point, it would require actions such as calling in ICE or the military to prevent an opponent from taking power. That is the point at which, without wanting to sound overly Pollyannaish, it is hard to imagine that if Trump tried to use one of these power agencies to overturn election results, they would simply salute and obey.

Subscribe

That concern sits in the background of discussions about going after Mark Kelly and other national security Democrats who advise soldiers not to obey unlawful orders. Trump is likely anticipating that he may issue unlawful orders and wants to ensure personal loyalty.

This ultimately comes down to a question we do not know the answer to: how would they react? One particularly worrisome area is ICE. It now has a budget larger than the FBI and larger than any other domestic law enforcement agency. It is recruiting very rapidly, and the people willing to join ICE at this point are likely to be strong Trump supporters.

It is possible that by next November he will have a coercive instrument that is personally loyal to him, which creates some frightening possibilities for how it could be used. Still, it is hard to believe that this would not be a bridge too far, even for him, to use what would amount to military force to stay in power. What do you think?

Mounk:

Frank, you asked me a question that I want to respond to, but I am going to respond with another question. I think the assessment depends on the answer to the following issue.

There is one way of understanding what has happened over the last nine months that would make us relatively optimistic about the robustness of American institutions. This is a government that is breaking norms and rules, doing real damage, engaging in corruption, and committing serious abuses. Yet it does not seem close to concentrating power in a way that makes it impossible to report on the administration or criticize it. There is no media subjugation. The

New York Times

is not praising Donald Trump every day.

As you noted, there are concerns about local-level interference in the midterm elections. Still, I agree that it seems unlikely they could prevent a Democratic majority from taking seats in the House if Democrats win. The question then becomes why this is the case.

Is it because American institutions are undergoing an extraordinary stress test and, imperfectly and at great moral cost, are actually holding? Are they stopping Trump from concentrating power in the way Erdoğan has done in Turkey?

Or is it because the Trump administration is less competent than it initially appeared? Does it have less of a plan than it seemed in the first months? Is Trump too focused on personal revenge, too distracted, too consumed by posting rants on Truth Social? In that case, despite the extreme norm-breaking, we are not seeing a true stress test.

How are you reading this? How much confidence should we take from the apparent resilience of the system so far? To what extent is this simply good luck that, alongside his contempt for democratic norms, Trump is distractible, irascible, and more focused on personal advancement and corruption than on a systematic effort to dismantle the checks on his power?

Fukuyama:

Both of those things can be true at the same time. It could be that he is not as competent at dismantling democracy as he could be, and that there is also much more resistance than he anticipated. I am fairly confident that American institutions are going to survive the next year and that Democrats are likely to win the House. If that happens, Trump’s power will be significantly diminished.

The reason I say this is that a more coercive scenario, in which election results are ignored and force is used to maintain power, does not seem to be actively discussed by insiders. Republican loyalists and Trump loyalists are scrambling to decide what they will do once Democrats take over the House. They are not talking about going to Trump and telling him to call out ICE to prevent Democrats from taking their seats. Nobody is speaking that way.

I take that as a sign that people still respect basic democratic institutions. If voters clearly say they do not want this administration, there is a widespread assumption that power will have to be handed over. To plot a much more dangerous takeover would require a level of planning and coordination that I do not see evidence of.

I also think this goes beyond Trump himself. If you look at how he behaved around past elections, his efforts were always slapdash and reactive. I do not see signs that he is seriously contemplating the use of ICE or other coercive forces to overturn an election at this point.

Mounk:

But what if he did? That is the counterfactual. I agree that it does not seem likely, but in terms of our confidence that the American republic is going to survive not just Trump, but Vance or Donald Trump Jr., or whoever may come down the pipe in the next twenty years, do the last months give you more or less confidence that institutions could withstand a more systematic, cool-headed attempt to bring them down?

Fukuyama:

A lot of it has to do with the senior leadership of all the power institutions. Although Pete Hegseth has been trying to replace “woke” senior officers, I think that the socialization of the officer corps in the U.S. military is actually pretty thorough. They are going to have to purge a lot more people if they are going to find generals who would be willing to order their troops to support a totally illegal and unconstitutional seizure of power.

I think that even within the power institutions, it is divided. Governors theoretically control the National Guard. Police forces are completely separate. ICE is a new organization. Can they actually be used as the tip of the spear to take over the U.S. government? I do not know. That seems like a pretty difficult scenario to imagine, given that there are a lot of other organized groups with guns that might resist that.

I am not sure that anybody wants to walk down a path where you are fighting one of these organizations against the other.

Mounk:

I think there is a lot of very loose talk about civil war. Certainly, on some of the definitions of civil war that are current in political science at the moment, you can imaginably get to a civil war in the United States, but that is because they have defined a civil war down to about a hundred people who die from political violence over the course of a year in the United States.

We probably already have a few dozen a year in various ways, including assassinations and people who die in protests and other things. Might you get across the hundred line? Yes, that is absolutely imaginable.

To get to anything that a lay person would actually recognize as a civil war, you would have to have different strands of the administration of the American state squaring off against each other because of different interpretations about who is in charge or whether they should obey an unlawful order. I do not think that is completely unimaginable, but I think we are quite far away from that.

Fukuyama:

We have also had some examples where he sent National Guard troops from other states, from red states into blue cities. When we were imagining what a conflict would look like, it would be something like that, where the local authorities would resist these federal incursions.

They have been pretty cautious. They have done terrible things like arresting U.S. citizens and so forth, but they have not really pushed things to a real confrontation where the potential for that existed. Again, it gives you a little bit of hope that when push comes to shove, it is really not going to lead to violence.

Mounk:

I have to say that nowadays, one is not always impressed when dealing with various agencies of the American state. But every time that I have dealt with senior military officers or been invited to institutions like the Naval Academy, I have seen deeply serious people and deeply serious institutions. I think that this is a great asset that the United States retains.

We have not quite dealt with or covered the judicial element here. There are very different interpretations about whether the Supreme Court is doing Donald Trump’s bidding, which is the most extreme interpretation, whether it is trying to sidestep the biggest conflicts in order to avoid incurring Trump’s wrath, or whether there are more optimistic interpretations according to which it has a conservative majority that roughly reflects what the Federalist Society would have wanted in 2013 or 2014, before Donald Trump entered politics. Under that view, it really is a constitutionalist force that is going to rein in straightforward abuses of power and extreme abuses of power by Trump. Where do you fall along that interpretive spectrum?

One of the ways in which a Trump administration might try to get unstuck is by starting to ignore judicial rulings in a more extreme way than it has so far. This year, there were various points when a judge said that you cannot deport this person, and the administration said,

they are already on the plane. We did not get there in time

. Some of that was not sincere. Sometimes they did want to flout those rulings to some extent. But so far, they have not simply said, in response to a major ruling about what they have to do going forward,

we are just going to ignore the Supreme Court. How many troops do you have?

That is a dog that has not barked yet. Might that dog bark in the next three years? How do you see the balance between the executive and the judicial branches going forward over that period?

Fukuyama:

Well, the lower levels of the federal judiciary have been very good, I think. They have actually pushed back against some of the patently illegal things that Trump has tried to do through executive order. So the big question is really the Supreme Court. I would say by the time we all come back from Christmas break, we are going to know there are three really big cases that are in front of the Supreme Court right now where there is probably going to be a decision.

Not waiting until the end of the term in June, but within the next few weeks. So one is the 14th Amendment birthright citizenship case. The second is a tariffs case. The third is the overturning of

Humphrey’s Executor

. My prediction right now is that Trump is actually going to lose on both the tariffs and the 14th Amendment cases, and he will probably win and succeed on the

Humphrey’s Executor

one.

Mounk:

Which is roughly consonant with the Federalist Society theory of the case? The Federalist Society before Trump entered politics would likely have been in favor of overturning something like

Humphrey’s Executor

, but not have suggested the other two points.

Fukuyama:

That is right. You can see this. The

Wall Street Journal

has been very critical of birthright citizenship and the tariffs, certainly, but actually are all in favor of overturning

Humphrey’s Executor

, and they kind of represent traditional conservative republicanism. I think that based on the oral arguments before the court on the tariffs, it is a real uphill struggle to defend the current policy. I think that the 14th Amendment one is just so contrary to the obvious text of the Constitution. That one revolves around this one little phrase, “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.”

The 14th Amendment says that all persons born and naturalized in the territory of the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States. The conservatives are trying to overturn this on that little phrase, that somehow immigrants, illegal immigrants, are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. First of all, if you are an originalist, this is a completely fraudulent argument because what that is referring to is actually Native Americans, because at the time that the 14th Amendment was passed, you still had Indian tribes that were regarded as sovereign nations.

Subscribe

I think what that phrase is referring to is the fact that they are still sovereign and we are going to respect that they do not simply come under the jurisdiction of the United States because they have their own sovereignty. It is also just not the case that illegal immigrants are not subject to the laws of the United States. They may be evading those laws, but they are certainly subject to them.

I really do not see grounds for seriously overturning the 14th Amendment. Then the political question becomes: if Trump suffers these two major setbacks, what is he going to do ? I am not sure he can do much of anything except flail around. Certainly with the tariffs, he will try to find other legal authorities to keep them in place. But it is going to be really messy. There are going to be all these lawsuits trying to get back the tariff money that companies had to surrender to the government. It does not look good for him if that were to happen.

Mounk:

When you look around the world, the picture of the United States is in a sense mixed, which is to say that it has really been a very, very bad year for the United States, but you can also see perhaps Trump’s time in the limelight beginning to end.

It is not that hard to imagine Democrats winning in 2028, though of course the Democratic Party has its own deep challenges of unpopularity which remain. You look around the West more broadly and it just becomes extremely obvious that this political moment is not over. We thought that Poland might have turned a corner in recent elections, and then the presidential elections went for the representative of a Law and Justice right-wing populist party.

You see Giorgia Meloni quite firmly in office in Italy, even though at least in foreign policy she has proven to be more moderate than might have been expected. Most importantly, you see in polls Nigel Farage’s Reform leading in Britain, Jordan Bardella or Marine Le Pen, depending on who will run, which turns on a court ruling, leading quite clearly in presidential polls in France.

The Alternative for Germany is the number one party in national opinion polls. That does not mean that it would be likely to rule those federal elections, which are quite a while away in any case, because it is a system of proportional representation and they are not anywhere close to an absolute majority. They may very well enter government in the first state parliaments in East Germany and may even get an absolute majority in one of them.

Clearly, whatever this moment is, it is not over. Whatever is driving the rise of these populist parties is continuing. The phenomenal weakness of the moderates on the center left or on the center right is continuing to deepen.

I do think that that should give us an expectation for the United States that, in conjunction with what is happening in Britain, France, and Germany, and what you have seen in Poland with a quick backlash to a more moderate government, I very easily can imagine Democrats winning in 2028 because the Trump administration is going off the rails and is way outside the cultural mainstream of the United States.

Trump is now quite unpopular and it is not clear that he has a successor who has his charisma and all of that. It is not hard to imagine a Democrat winning in 2028, a Democrat winning in 2032 and 2036, even if Republicans run very extreme candidates. Democrats actually building the broad political majority that will be required to last and move beyond this moment is much harder to imagine given the international context. How do you assess this overall moment for democracy outside of the United States, or beyond the United States?

Fukuyama:

Well, those are two separate questions which we should discuss in turn. I think that the danger in Europe is clear, but there is also a danger that if you catastrophize too much, you get discouraged and think that you cannot really fight back. I think there are plenty of ways of fighting back. One of the most important things about Europe is actually the fact that they have got proportional representation.

That leads to none of these populist parties actually getting a majority in their legislatures. At that point, even if they do better in the coming elections, the other parties have two choices. They can actually form a coalition or they can form a cordon sanitaire. That is what the Austrian parties are doing right now to keep the Freedom Party out of power.

Either way, I think that reduces the threat from these populist parties. Going into a coalition with them may be the better of the two strategies because, generally speaking, this happened both with Geert Wilders’ party in the Netherlands and with the Danish People’s Party. They were part of coalitions, and they had to govern, and they had to actually make compromises.

They could not pose as these radical outsiders that were going to change everything. People just lost interest in them. I think that there are ways of dealing with them. There are also things that we do not know, like Jordan Bardella in France. From a lot of his behavior, it seems like, at the moment at least, he is much closer to Giorgia Meloni than to Viktor Orbán.

He has been meeting with business leaders, and I think that the French people themselves are not willing to give up on the EU and turn hard against it the way the Hungarians have. They have got a presidential system. They have got a winner-take-all system, even though it is a two-round system. There is going to be one president of France, but I am not convinced that if it is him, it is necessarily going to be such a disastrous outcome.

Again, all these things are interdependent. By the time these European elections happen, if Trump really looks like he is on his way out, that is also going to affect them and make the populist parties not seem like an inevitable wave that is going to hit everybody, but rather like a shot that was taken and just missed the target.

Mounk:

I agree with much of what you said, just to play devil’s advocate on two points. The first is that neither Britain nor France really have a proportional representation system. In Britain, you are right that Nigel Farage is far from having 50% of the vote in opinion polls. But if the polls do not change from what they are at the moment, he probably would have a clear majority of his own in Parliament.

Obviously in France, as you pointed out, it is a runoff presidential system. Bardella is very likely to be in the second round of the election, and he is leading in most matchups, certainly against any left-leaning candidate. Against some center, center-right candidates like Édouard Philippe, it looks around 50–50, and that is a little bit harder to call. But that is actually extraordinary.

Even against those center-right or center-centrist candidates, he really is leading. When you match him up against somebody like Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the far-left candidate, Mélenchon may very well get through to the second round because he has a big personal following, even though he is very unpopular among the French electorate as a whole. Bardella may win by 75% or more. It would be the inverse of that famous election in 2002, where Jacques Chirac was running for a second term in office against Jean-Marie Le Pen, when 80% of French people voted for the center-right, moderate candidate.

This time around, it may be the far-right candidate, the inheritor of Le Pen’s movement, that may win a supermajority in that election if it really ends up being a matchup against Mélenchon. Then what does that do to where Europe stands?

I agree with you that Farage and Bardella are probably more moderate figures than Trump in a number of ways. It is certainly true. Farage was an enemy of the European Union and one of the reasons why Britain left the European Union. Bardella is not saying that he wants to leave the European Union. I have heard, though, that he has said in private conversations to people that he is going to go to Frankfurt, to the European Central Bank, as one of his first acts in office and say either you are buying our debt and helping us out of our budgetary crisis or everything is going to blow up, and France is too big to fail.

There is certainly, I do not think he wants to leave the EU, but I think he wants to make demands of the EU that are going to be very hard for Germany and the Netherlands and other countries to swallow, in a way that would lead to a significant political crisis in the EU.

The final point I want to make is that if you can take populist parties in as a junior coalition partner, that seems to have been a good strategy in certain circumstances. That has happened in the Netherlands and some other countries where they ultimately were forced into taking decisions and having responsibility for government. They were unable to deliver on all of their aspirations, and that led to them bleeding support.

However, in many of these countries, it is now going to be a question of whether the center-right party wants to be the junior coalition partner that puts them into the prime minister’s chair, that puts them into the president’s seat, that is going to make them take power altogether. That seems to me like a much harder calculation.

Fukuyama:

Although even having a junior coalition partner is still going to force you to back off of certain extreme positions. Look, I am not looking forward to Europe’s future, particularly the lack of really inspiring leaders. Keir Starmer has been one of the worst. Everybody breathes a big sigh of relief when he was elected after all these crazy people that conservatives were putting up, but he has just been so uninspiring.

Mounk:

Starmer, I think, is a genuine warning for the Democrats in the United States. Starmer won a big electoral victory, a relatively narrow one in terms of popular vote, but with a huge parliamentary majority, a very successful election. He won it because people were sick of a Conservative Party that had ruled poorly, that had gotten more extreme in various ways, even though Rishi Sunak, the last Conservative prime minister, was a relative moderate.

They were relieved that the Labour Party was run by somebody more moderate than Jeremy Corbyn and others, and that was enough to get him elected. Once you are in office, people do not judge you by the alternatives they have evaded in the past. They judge you by whether you have a programme and whether you have a vision. Keir Starmer does not have that. That is a big difference to the Third Way, which had flaws of its own.

Back when Bill Clinton was elected in the United States and when Tony Blair was elected in Britain, they did actually have a program. Part of that was a program of cultural renewal, which felt real at the time. The whole moment of Cool Britannia, not Rule Britannia, but Cool Britannia, the more modern, exciting Britain.

I remember when Gerhard Schröder was elected in Germany, not somebody who ended up having a distinguished chancellorship and certainly not somebody who ended up having a distinguished post-chancellorship as a stooge of Vladimir Putin’s. I was 16 years old. I had been ruled all of my life by Helmut Kohl. Schröder signified this kind of cultural liberation, this moving on from this dodgy Germany of the 1980s and early 1990s. There was a moment of excitement.

Starmer did not have any of that. When you lack all of that and all you are is

I am not Boris Johnson and I am not Jeremy Corbyn

, then very quickly you are going to be judged very negatively. Are we meeting the moment intellectually? Do we need to renew the liberal tradition in order to get out of this moment? Do we need to renew what it is like for people committed to liberal democracy to make a real offer to voters?

Do we need to throw the kind of assumptions that I was raised with as somebody who came of age politically in the early 2000s overboard in a much more radical way in order to start from scratch? Or do you think we have the intellectual building blocks of what a world after Donald Trump and Nigel Farage looks like, and we just need to get politicians to buy into it and build on it? How lost are we intellectually, do you think?

Fukuyama:

Well, I do not know the answer to that. I do think there is a way forward for liberals. As you know, I have been very much a fan of this abundance agenda, but it has to do really with state power and executive authority. So one thing that Trump has done that is going to outlast him is that he has changed the nature of executive authority.

I think that one of the reasons that you get these strongman populist leaders appealing to people is that existing liberal governments are just stuck. They cannot do stuff. They have accumulated way too many rules and constraints and so forth. It shows up in a lot of ways. The shoot-him-in-the-legs instinct comes from police forces that are very constrained in the way they go after criminals.

This is very much an issue in Latin America, where they really do have an out-of-control crime problem, and democratic governments following strict rule of law have simply not been able to deal with this issue. In the United States, I think it really does have to do with things like infrastructure and the ability to do public projects, which really are very constrained.

We just had this example of a public toilet, one public toilet, just one toilet, one toilet seat costing $1.7 million and taking years to construct. I think that, as

Mark Dunkelman

has argued, we have gone through these phases, either Hamiltonian or Jeffersonian. The Hamiltonians want to use state power effectively to do things in the common interest, and the Jeffersonians are extremely suspicious of concentrated state power and therefore want to spread it out as far as they can.

Really since the 1960s, we have been in a very Jeffersonian moment where power is really pushed down to civil society, to localities. Here in California, a lot of cities have been able to block really important statewide and, in fact, nationally important projects because of that shift in the balance of power. So I think that what abundance signifies is a recognition that state power, democratically legitimated and staying within the boundaries of the rule of law, can actually be used for good purposes.

We have had a couple of generations of young Americans who do not believe that it is possible, that the enemy is the government. There they join hands with traditional conservatives that never liked the government. So I think that any vision for reviving liberalism has to be built around a different conception of the state, that a democratically legitimated state can actually do things. It needs to be freed to do things in many different domains, not simply building things, but also dealing with a lot of problems that just seem beyond the capacity of contemporary government.

That is my general feeling about it. It is not a departure from liberalism, because liberal societies used to be able to do this. I keep using this example, but in the early 1930s the United States built the Golden Gate Bridge and the Tennessee Valley Authority. All of these things happened within the space of three or four years. That was kind of peak Hamiltonianism, when the Roosevelt administration used the government to do a lot of progressive things. I think that is a vision that we could and really need to return to.

Mounk:

To what extent is the problem that liberalism with a capital L, or just democratic norms, are often being invoked to justify things that are deeply inefficient and unjustifiable in ways that are not exactly right? It is not that liberalism or democratic norms require those things. One example of this is that there is so much process around getting anything built.

Supposedly this is because of the rule of law, and because of liberalism and individual rights. But it is really because of a set of legal procedures, administrative procedures, and environmental laws that we have chosen. We absolutely had the rule of law in periods of American history where you could build a railway, and in fact a railway is good for the environment. It is not required by that.

Another area of this relates to immigration. When you look at Europe, a lot of very basic abilities to close the border and deport people are being undercut by extremely generous interpretations of a European charter of human rights and other doctrines by European judges. You are effectively forcing a lot of people to choose between whether they want to respect the rule of law or whether they want to have some sense that their politicians are able to do something about borders.

You frame the question that way, where people say they care more about limiting immigration than they care about democracy, and you end up with a huge problem. The third area of this is public safety. There you have comparative differences. Europe has more of a welfare state and, in general, lower levels of crime than the United States.

But also in a European supermarket, if you go in and steal a bunch of stuff, there is going to be a security guard who will tackle you and detain you until the police arrive. You are probably not going to go to jail for very long because European laws are not particularly punitive, but they will stop you from doing this.

In the United States, for reasons I have never fully understood, there is a new pharmacy in my neighborhood in New York where half of the things are locked up. This is a famous talking point. It is striking. Part of the reason is that if I went in there, picked up a bunch of things, and walked out, the security guard would not stop me because of rules they are told to follow.

Perhaps that is because there are more guns in the United States, or insurance, or whatever the reason. But there are democracies in Europe that are able to set things up so that when a store has a security guard, the guard will actually stop you from stealing. That makes things more functional than saying you will let someone go and perhaps a police officer will later review the video footage and arrest them. Most likely that is never going to happen.

How is it that we can diffuse this real conflict between the rule of law and democracy and our ability to get things done, a conflict that is real not for unchangeable reasons, but because we have made bad choices?

Fukuyama:

Well, I think that most of the constraints on our ability to do things are the result of bad choices and are completely unnecessary. I could entertain you for the next hour just telling you stories of ridiculous rules that make it very difficult to build things or make decisions. You are absolutely right.

For example, in Britain, why is Nigel Farage making a comeback right now? In 2016, the British people voted narrowly, to be sure, to leave the European Union. The thing that was most upsetting to them was high levels of immigration. Despite that vote, and despite the trauma of leaving the EU, levels of immigration went up after that vote.

I think that the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights did play a role in making it very hard. I remember David Cameron at one point, there was a Syrian terrorist in Britain who had actually committed violent offenses in Britain, and they wanted to send him back to Syria, and the European court would not let them do that. That seems to me a perfect example of there being too much rule of law.

It is very difficult, it seems, for any modern liberal democracy to actually roll things back. They have a hard time making a trade-off between having yet more rules and procedures and goals like efficiency and effectiveness. But it has got to be done. I think that if you do not do it, you are going to be constantly subject to these strongmen who are going to say, “I am just going to ignore the rule of law completely and smash everything.” There has got to be a middle ground between those positions.

Mounk:

Another striking example of this comes from Rory Stewart, the British politician, back when he was in charge of the UK Development Agency. He was Secretary of State for International Development. He discovered that some part of the money was going through to an organization that he had reason to mistrust. I forget whether he was basically certain that it was going to support terrorist violence or whether it was a suspicion, but he thought we really should not be giving money to this organization.

He goes through this kind of extraordinary process that he had to go through, and the extent to which he had to keep getting senior civil servants into his office and corralling them to say, have we stopped paying the money? It was because of bureaucratic procedures and hurdles and the rule of law and all kinds of things that it was virtually impossible for him to make sure the British state would stop giving money to this dangerous group.

It is extraordinary. None of that justifies any of what Trump has been doing, but it explains why people look at something like that and say, perhaps that is what we need. I think getting that under control from within, by people who actually care about good governance and the rule of law and protecting it, is exactly the case.

I do not want to go on too much longer, but a little bit more of an international outlook. What is the situation in Ukraine at the end of 2025? Are we going to see an end to that horrible war in 2026? Is there any chance left of seeing an end to that war, not a just end to that war, because I do not think that is realistic at all, but at least one that avoids that conflict being reignited by Russia within the next few years and gives some relatively basic security guarantees to Ukraine?

Fukuyama:

Well, I am very worried about Ukraine after four years of really horrible fighting. Anything that is on the table right now is only going to delay a Russian attempt to take over. It is quite remarkable that Putin has not given an inch. There was this recent meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders where they were trying to modify the 28-point document to actually strengthen some of the guarantees and walk back some of the territorial concessions.

Even if they can get Trump to support this, it is not clear to me that Putin is going to agree to any of it. I think it probably will require much more unilateral measures on the part of the Europeans. They have got to overcome the reluctance of Belgium to release the sequestered Russian money.

Ukraine needs about $30 billion of budget support every year. The Europeans have been giving that, but they cannot do that forever. There are ways of getting around it, but European decision-making being what it is, it can be vetoed very easily by one reluctant party. Right now, I do not know exactly where that stands. They are certainly trying to get past that veto, and that of Hungary and Slovakia, but whether they will succeed is still very dicey.

The most outrageous thing, I think, is the capitulation, the moral capitulation, involved in this idea that we are actually going to make business deals and that our major objective in this negotiation should not be the security of a democratic Ukraine, but new opportunities for joint US–Russian business ventures that the whole Trump family can get involved in. It is so repulsive and appalling. I am not really optimistic about any of that. Even if all the optimistic things I said about next year’s election come true, I do not think it is going to happen early enough to really help Ukraine much.

As that bon vivant Eustace Tilley might have put it,

The New Yorker

was recently spotted in an unlikely locale—on Substack. In a jaunty little note, the storied magazine

declared

, “Yep, we’re on Substack toö. Your favorite hundred year-old magazine is crashing the party.” And the reaction on the platform was… a bit different from what might have been expected. “Oh FUCK OFF please,” wrote one user in a comment that was liked over 100 times. “Who actually reads and enjoys this?”

wrote

another. “More and more the NYer feels like an artifact, no longer relevant to our time,”

wrote

The Literarian Gazette. “They’re not even sure what they do anymore,”

wrote

the essayist Jacob Savage.

The problem, really, was about register—and seemed to be entirely lost on

The New Yorker.

It was exactly as if your mother, who had abandoned you as a child to run off with the general manager of a golf club, had now returned to the neighborhood and wanted to be your best friend.

The New Yorker—

it’s absolutely true—

is

just about everybody’s favorite hundred-year-old magazine. It has a reputation for combining fun and sophistication that is unparalleled, and the magazine inspires a certain loyalty that is unimaginable in virtually any other publication. Ben Yagoda, in his magisterial history

About Town: The New Yorker and the World It Made

,

opens with the anecdote of a nurse speaking to a dying soldier at the end of World War II and discovering that what he really wanted to talk about, most of all, was

The New Yorker.

That example, if extreme, is representative. In over seven hundred responses Yagoda received from a survey, the overwhelming sensibility was that

The New Yorker

was part of the deep structure of everybody’s intellectual life—respondents decorated their houses in

New Yorker

covers, spent decades trying to win the caption contest, described themselves as being “nourished” by

The New Yorker

or having their sense of humor “created” by

The New Yorker.

And at 100,

The New Yorker

is barely showing its age. It is venerable, storied, indestructible, but has the same saucy tone of your very brightest child about to put on a living room extravaganza. Which is exactly the problem.

The New Yorker

didn’t

have quite the effortless path to success that everybody sort of assumes it did. It was founded, as Yagoda writes, “on champagne vapor”—an offshoot of the

Algonquin Round Table

, with the seed capital put up by the editor’s poker buddy and, for a while, it was, by all accounts, terrible. The blog

My Life 100 Years Ago

helpfully reads through the first issue—the racist cartoons, the sophomoric jokes—and, out of many candidates, settles on the following line as the single most boring from the gossip section: “Jerome (‘Jerry’) D. Kern was in town one day buying some second-hand books.” The kind of permanent souvenir of that time is the image of “Eustace Tilley,” the fictional monocled dandy who has been the logo of

The New Yorker

from that day to this. Tilley was meant to poke fun at other serious-seeming literary magazines of the day, but there was always the danger that the accusation could land on

The New Yorker

itself—that it was an extension of what the critic Edmund Wilson called the class of “people who had been taught a certain kind of gentility, who had played the same games and read the same children’s books—all of which they were now able to mock from a level of New York sophistication.”

Based on its early years, there was no particular reason to ever think that

The New Yorker

would outgrow the specter of Eustace Tilley. There was very little serious journalism, the short stories were basically glorified scene pieces, and the aroma of the student lounge clung to everything. But then, at some point in the 1930s, the miracle happened. A new group of streetwise writers, most famously Joseph Mitchell and A.J. Liebling, found their way into the magazine and introduced a grit and seriousness that had been utterly lacking in the frothy early years. To Yagoda, the magazine actually reached its peak in the ‘30s, but other accounts put the turning-point a little further forward—to the decision, in 1946, to turn the entire issue over to John Hersey’s searing account of the destruction of Hiroshima; or to the publication of J.D. Salinger’s short story “A Perfect Day for Bananafish” in 1948, which launched Salinger’s career and vaulted

The New Yorker

’s

fiction department beyond the scene-y pieces of an earlier era.

I teach a journalism class, and when I do I seem to always find myself back in this same moment in time—when, in Yagoda’s framing, “lowlife [was] ascendant.” The new generation of writers worked hard to get beyond Eustace Tilley. “We were thinking about the best way we could write about the city without all the literary framework,” Mitchell recalled, and what they came up with transformed journalism forever. In 1942, Mitchell published a piece called “Professor Sea Gull” about a “Bowery Bum” named Joe Gould. It opens, “Joe Gould is a jaunty and emaciated little man who has been a notable in the cafeterias, diners, barrooms, and dumps for a quarter of a century.” The challenge for me teaching this piece is that it’s always difficult not to get a little misty with the idea of what the piece represents—that

anybody

is interesting, that, in the higher order of things,

anybody

is worthy of a

New Yorker

profile, that if you look and listen in the right way you find that any homeless person you pass on the street is worthy of a full book (or, in a way, of the entire career that Mitchell devoted to Gould).

As I continue with the course, I make my way through a greatest hits of other

New Yorker

pieces—all of them espousing the same virtues. There’s Alex Prud’Homme’s “

Albert Yeganeh: The Man Behind the Soups

,” the basis for the

Seinfeld

“Soup Nazi” episode in which the reader is perfectly on the knife’s edge between seeing Yeganeh as crazy, as a big city amusement, and understanding that his madness is a form of perfectionism worthy of any artist. There’s Ian Frazier’s “

My Son Is The Naked Cowboy

,” in which Frazier sits next to the father of the Times Square street attraction famous for wandering the city in his underwear and just lets him talk and it turns out—I have to be on my guard against mistiness here too—that the naked cowboy’s father is just really, really proud of him for having found his way in life. And there’s a tireless

Good Samaritan

who knocks on the windows of idling vehicles and asks them to turn off the engine to help the environment—and is, as often as not, flipped off or screamed at for his trouble. And there’s A.J. Liebling’s wartime obsession with “

Mollie

,” a Times Square busboy who somehow captured 600 Italian soldiers singlehandedly, and on and on it goes.

But something peculiar happens when I look at the more recent catalog. There’s a piece on “The Many Stages of Cynthia Nixon.” And one on how “Chloe Zhao Has Looked Into the Void.” And on how “Sarah Sherman Is Grosser Than You Think.” And on how “Mikie Sherill Intends To Move Fast.” And I have to scroll a long, long way, in other words, to find an article about somebody who has never appeared on HBO or has not been elected to office. Joe Gould—

and

the Naked Cowboy’s father

and

Albert Yeganeh driving himself to ever greater heights to perfect his soups—are all a long way away.

Subscribe

And the same goes if I start flipping around in the other sections—everywhere there’s the same overpowering sense that

The New Yorker,

which more or less invented profile writing and championed a very particular curious and irreverent sensibility, is no longer

for

or

about

anybody you know. The articles I’ve mentioned would all look perfectly at home if they were published instead in

Vanity Fair.

The sensibility is that it’s meant to be about people who’ve

arrived—

it’s something like

Puck

with a hundred-year head start. And, as

The New Yorker,

with all due fanfare and stentoriousness, celebrates its first century, it’s become clear also that it’s no longer really

The New Yorker—

the logo is there and the covers and cartoons are there, but the spirit that animated

The New Yorker

throughout its long golden era is finally gone.

This isn’t the

first time that the more magpie-ish among us have claimed that

The New Yorker

has lost its way. Yagoda concedes that by the ‘70s or ‘80s

The New Yorker

was a “creepy place”—one aspiring editor, for his first assignment, found himself taking dictation from an old racing reporter who phoned in stories from his hospital bed about wholly imaginary horse races. An attempted takeover by Warren Buffett was stymied by the stratagem of setting up Buffett with the magazine’s longtime editor, at which point Buffett saw what he was up against and promptly divested his stock. In 1986, a book-length parody of

The New Yorker

appeared entitled

Snooze

.

As far back as 1999, the writer and former

New Yorker

staffer Renata Adler

declared

, “As I write this,

The New Yorker

is dead.”

The usual story from this point is that after a period of ownership and editorial changes,

The New Yorker

found stability under editor David Remnick, who led the magazine into a new golden age. The internet presented an existential challenge

,

as it did to all print publications, but

The New Yorker

managed the transition better than most, with a robust online publication complementary to the print magazine, as well as podcast and video content. “

The New Yorker

has not only adapted to the digital age but thrived in it,”

reported

The Conversation

earlier this year. In an interview for the Netflix documentary

The New Yorker at 100,

Remnick

said

simply, “

The New Yorker

is a miracle, ok?”

That’s the usual story. My contention is that

The New Yorker

has lost its soul, is now virtually interchangeable with a number of other publications, and is—spiritually speaking—in something like terminal decline, just another gilded gargoyle on the cathedral of polite thinking. Those are unprovable statements and whether you agree with them or not depends on your reading sensibility, but let’s consider a few areas of striking weakness.

In its fiction,

The New Yorker

was famous above all for launching the careers of writers. J.D. Salinger, John Updike, John O’Hara, John Cheever, James Thurber, E. B. White, Ann Beattie, among many, many others, got their real breaks through

The New Yorker.

There’s a sort of iconic story of literary persistence in which Beattie, then a college instructor, sent a submission to

The New Yorker.

An assistant pulled it out of the slush pile. Roger Angell, the chief fiction editor, sent a note to Beattie asking her to send future submissions to him directly. He passed on the next 13 stories she sent him, but when Angell finally bought one, he couldn’t have been happier if he had written it himself: “I think this is just about the best news of the year,” he

wrote

to Beattie. “There is nothing that gives me more pleasure than at last sending an enthusiastic yes to a writer who has persisted through as many rejections and rebuffs as you have.”

It’s a heart-warming story, but

it could not happen now.

Bill Buford, who was

The

New Yorker’s

fiction editor for eight years,

admitted

that he hadn’t taken a single story from slush during that time, and Deborah Treisman, the current fiction editor,

appears not to have either

. That wouldn’t be particularly a big deal—lots of magazines limit submissions to “agent enquiries only”—except that

The New Yorker

keeps

an open inbox

and

promises to read “all submissions within 90 days.” In other words, it is still masquerading as the magazine that discovered Beattie and profiled Gould, but in fact the real path to entry is to already be a part of whatever club Eustace Tilley is a member of. Even apart from the evident dishonesty in its policy, what

The New Yorker’s

down-portcullis approach seems to have done is to produce a stale, safe, walled garden of forgettable fiction. In a somewhat embarrassing moment in

The New Yorker at 100,

Treisman, in an editorial meeting, complains that one story under consideration is “right on that borderline of being like ten other stories,” to which her fellow editor less-than-ringingly responds, “I’d be borderline in favor.”

The same criticism goes for the Shouts & Murmurs section, which can feel like a roundtable of all of Eustace Tilley’s most toffish friends complaining about their imaginary problems. (The article “

This Bowl Has One Hundred Grams of Protein

,” on the website front page at the time of publication, can stand in for all the rest—unless you feel that

“So You Want to Come to My New Vinyl-Listening Bar”

covers it better.) And for the profiles, which have turned into frothy celebrity-bait. And for the attempts to connect with the American heartland in the Trump era, which often are embarrassingly tone-deaf. (In the documentary, staff writer Andrew Marantz concedes that

The New Yorker’s

haters may have a point when they accuse

The New Yorker

of being “elitist motherfuckers” and the magazine’s editorial department then carefully adds an accent

aigu

When you start to take all that away, there’s not much left. Yes,

The New Yorker

has had some astonishing successes in the Remnick era—Ronan Farrow’s piece on Harvey Weinstein did a great deal to topple Weinstein and to spark the #MeToo movement; Luke Mogelson has had a gift for popping up everywhere from a trench to the Donbas to the mob storming the Capitol in 2021. But try to think of the last time

The New Yorker

has broken a story or captured the discourse in a way that used to be routine for them—and my guess is that you’ll find yourself thinking for quite some time.

The reasons

The New Yorke

r may have struggled in the 21st century are certainly not entirely their fault. The landscape of journalism is very different. “Stories” are being broken all the time in social media posts; a “talk of the town” is hardly needed to generate gossip. A publication like

The New Yorker

is, very often, reduced to commentary on subjects that everybody else already has opinions about. And in that commentary there is an unmistakable tendency to just wish all the problems of the contemporary world away, to pretend that it is still 1925 and the only people one really needs to hear from are those in one’s club. (In one of

The New Yorker

’s earliest successful gags, the workers down an open manhole are

discussing

who and who isn’t a Whitney—talking exactly like high society would talk—and it can feel as if that actually is the heart of the publication: Eustace Tilley’s recurring fantasy that everybody else in the city and country actually turns out to be exactly like him.)

The New Yorker

at 100

gives yet another glimpse of how this smugness plays out. Remnick, in an attempt to blow the dust away, has a meeting where he asks a group of the paper’s old guard what

New Yorker

traditions have outlived their time, and then he brings up the question of voice. “One subject that has come up for decades and decades is the following: I’m worried that I won’t be able to write in my voice,” Remnick says but gets no further than that. “When I have very occasionally had that experience, it’s ‘cause they’re bad writers,” one of the editors responds. At which point the room erupts in a chorus of Eustace Tilley-ish chuckles, and the issue, presumably, is laid to rest for another hundred years. And never mind that some of those bad writers who have

complained

are E. B. White, Louise Bogan, John O’Hara, Kay Boyle, Irwin Shaw, Edmund Wilson, Rumer Godden, Roald Dahl, Elizabeth Bishop, Tom Wolfe, and Renata Adler (Dahl, for instance, claimed the magazine’s edits made him vow to give up writing and become a bookie instead); and never mind that some of the writers

The New Yorker

has managed to reject, in what Yagoda calls “a grim anthology,” include Kurt Vonnegut, Flannery O’Connor, Jack Kerouac, Joseph Heller, Gertrude Stein, and Thomas Pynchon.

The point that

Eustace Tilley might make, peering extra intently through his monocle, is that

The New Yorker,

my dear, has always been snobby. Actually, the snobbishness precedes the magazine itself. “

The New Yorker

will be the magazine which is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque,” its 1924 prospectus declared. (This, by the way, produced one of the better counter-offensives in literary history when an extremely erudite and cultured old lady from Dubuque showed up in New York in 1964 and gracefully did the rounds of the talk shows.) And, yes, it’s true that

The New Yorker

is proudly sophisticated. But sophistication and snootiness are very different—at its best,

The New Yorker

is always rooting for the little guy, its writers perfectly willing to chuck everything and wander around the city with Joe Gould. Or, as David Remnick put it in the documentary, “I want it to be great [and] I want it to be humane.”

It’s that sense of the humane that goes missing in the endless welter of celebrity profiles and smug cultural commentary—and, without it,

The New Yorker

loses all capacity to be great, no matter how

assiduously they fact-check

or how many rewrites they put their writers through. And that means that, when

The New Yorker

half-heartedly decides to leave its ivory tower and rub shoulders with the people for a bit, the people just aren’t really having it—any more than

The New Yorker

could expect the guys down the manholes to actually be discussing the pedigree of the Whitneys. The balance that the magazine has had to strike has always been razor-thin, but for it to work—this was what Mitchell and Liebling discovered in the ‘30s—you have to actually go down into the manholes and hear what, in

New Yorker

parlance, the “lowlifes” have to say. If you don’t do that, it’s just the ghost of Eustace Tilley goofing around with all of his monocled friends.

(Photo by Clemens Bilan Poo.)

Given the sheer number of summits, talks, and bilateral negotiations held between the United States, Ukraine, and Russia since the start of Trump’s time in office, one would be forgiven for getting a dash of déjà vu around the latest

talks

between Ukraine’s Zelenskyy and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff in Berlin. The issues at play are still essentially the same ones as back in February—security guarantees for Ukraine and territorial concessions to Russia.

But this time is different, and Ukraine is in more trouble than it has been in at any time since Trump’s return to office. Ukraine has already indicated that it is willing to make significant concessions in its negotiating stance. Its few allies in the Trump administration have been sidelined, and Europe is in no position to pick up the slack from ebbing U.S. support. Ironically, Ukraine’s greatest friend at the moment is—in a sense—Vladimir Putin, whose intransigence stands in the way of a deal favorable to Russia and risks alienating Trump. But with Trump’s patience running thin, Ukraine may very soon find itself forced to accept a deal it does not want.

As always, the deck is stacked against Zelenskyy. Trump and his envoys want a

quick end

to the war above all else, treating critical issues like territorial control and the security architecture of post-war Eastern Europe like pesky details standing in the way of Trump’s much-coveted “ninth” peace deal (on top of the eight he already claims to have overseen in various global conflicts). Zelenskyy has been doing everything in his power to meet the U.S. president halfway, but this time it may well not be enough. Trump seems to have decided that the quickest way to end the war is to force Ukraine to capitulate to Russia’s terms.

Trump has been drifting toward this conclusion for some time now, and Russia’s latest rejection of Trump’s peace proposal earlier this month has apparently only added fuel to the fire. Yuri Ushakov, one of Russia’s top negotiators, has said that any Ukrainian or European suggestions for a peace proposal would be met with “

sharp objections

,” while Russia’s ambassador to the UK claimed that the only thing Ukraine should be negotiating on is its “

surrender

.” The Trump administration has clearly internalized this mindset, and during the Berlin talks it

reportedly insisted

that Ukraine would have to withdraw from the parts of Donetsk Oblast it currently controls in order for a peace deal to be possible—a goal Russia has been pursuing since the start of its invasion.

In response to Trump’s demands, Zelenskyy has

agreed

to hold elections in Ukraine, and, to sweeten the deal, he has also shockingly

agreed

to give up his country’s NATO aspirations—a massive shift in Ukrainian policy. But even though such strategies have successfully allowed Zelenskyy to make Russia look like the spoiler in Trump’s eyes in the past, this time they will achieve little besides convincing Trump that Zelenskyy may indeed be pliable enough for the United States and Russia to ram through whatever further concessions they desire.

Zelenskyy has several options

at his disposal, but none of them are good. As always, he can try to lean on Europe to support him diplomatically vis-à-vis Trump, to fund Ukraine’s defense, and to provide security guarantees against Russia in the near term and after an eventual ceasefire.

This is seemingly the path he has taken in the wake of the Berlin talks—German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has

flattered Trump

, put out a statement

emphasizing

Ukraine’s post-war security needs, and gathered European leaders from Poland to the UK to lend support to Ukraine.

But it’s no secret that Europe’s pull is largely illusory—ever since the start of the current stage of negotiations, EU leaders have been unable to have any meaningful impact on the proposals Trump has offered the Russians. Putin has made serious efforts to

depict

the Europeans as being “on the side of war,” and it seems the Trump administration has taken the bait—the U.S. president increasingly sees the Europeans as adversaries, as the latest

National Security Strategy

makes clear. In talks following the Berlin negotiations, the Europeans have

unveiled

their proposal for security guarantees for Ukraine that include cooperation with the United States and a European-led “multinational force” operating inside Ukraine, and while this is encouraging for Zelenskyy, it is far from clear that the United States will commit to the proposal. Russia has balked at the presence of any NATO member forces in Ukraine after the war, and there is little reason to think Trump’s team would press Putin on this point.

Unfortunately for Europe and Ukraine, all such peace plans necessarily require American buy-in. Despite advances in its defense industry and its cohesiveness on the diplomatic front against the United States, Europe still clearly cannot match U.S. support for Ukraine, either militarily or on the intelligence front. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte

conceded this month

that Europe has no Plan B outside of relying on America for aid to Ukraine, even though the Trump administration has indicated it will

withdraw

much of its support by 2027.

Perhaps the only bright spot Ukraine can count on at this stage is its own armed forces, which have been taking every opportunity available to them to demonstrate that Russia’s slow march across Ukraine’s east is far from unstoppable. After Russia publicly claimed that it had captured the town of Kupyansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian forces swiftly eliminated Russian soldiers in the area, clearing the town enough for Zelenskyy himself to be able to

visit

and film a triumphant video not far from the frontlines. There was certainly good reason for his trip—a great deal of Trump’s pro-Russia tilt is based on the perception of an inexorable Russian advance. While it’s unclear whether the Ukrainians will be able to replicate their victory at Kupyansk along other, more dug-in parts of the frontline, the battle could demonstrate to Trump that Russia is far from invincible—if he’s paying attention, that is.

The sad truth for Zelenskyy, though, is that all of this may be too little, too late. Sooner or later, Zelenskyy will have to make the choice he predicted in

a somber video

at the end of November—“either the loss of dignity, or the risk of losing a key partner.” If he chooses the former, he will see his country carved up by an enemy and former ally. If he chooses the latter, he will see the United States abandon him in favor of a new economic and political thaw with Russia, leaving Ukraine and Europe at Russia’s mercy.
